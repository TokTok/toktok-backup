    "body": "I have real IP on my router and UDP port forwarding for my (q)Tox on the desktop. Thus it should be able  to use true p2p transfers always. But most often my file transfers are relayed i.e. slow (200-300 KB/sec only) and eats someone else's bandwidth.\r\n\r\nTo the same peers in the same other network (behind firewall without forwarding) sometimes file transfers are direct, sometimes are relayed. I have to reconect my qTox several times and eventually I begin to get direct transfers with such peer.\r\n\r\nOS: Windows on both sides.\r\n\r\n----\r\nAnother issue (maybe it is resolved?)\r\n\r\nWith direct transfers sometimes I experience huge issue. The file transfer begins slow, in few seconds gets speed up to the real capacity of my connection and then stops for 2-3 seconds. Then it begins to accelerate again and all is repeated. Again and again. In some moment the pause continues longer and the transfer breaks.\r\n\r\nIn the same time my ping doesnt show any packet loss and if I disable UDP relayed transfers are OK. qTox CPU usage is always under 1%.\r\n\r\nI think I began to experience it this year. Yesterday I've got it wth qTox 1.15 / toxcore 0.2.2. Then I installed the current qTox 1.16.3 with toxcore 0.2.3 and when I managed to get direct transfer this time it was fine. Maybe its fixed, maybe its random.\r\n\r\n----\r\nAfter Skype removal of p2p file transfers this was major reason for me to persuade people to use tox. But in the current way it is not good enough, sorry guys. When most people have such experience they dont investigate why file transfers are so slow or broke, they dont go to write issues in github neither, they just throw away tox.",
