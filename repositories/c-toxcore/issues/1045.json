For tox, it does not change anything effectively. Since when the first case is executed, they are exactly same! In fact, when the first case is executed, the message being handled is sent by onion_client.c(method client_send_announce_request) and there for the case num==0 to call create_announce_request.\r\n\r\nEven though effectively, this proposed change does not change anything for tox. But it provides some consistency: either cases, entry is identified by 32 bytes starts at plain + ONION_PING_ID_SIZE. Furthermore, with this modification, further improvement becomes possible.\r\n\r\nWith the above change, to distinguish setting up an entry from detecting an entry is purely by the pingid. Then I can use packet_public_key for some other purpose since it is not tied to identifier of the entry.\r\n\r\nso please!\r\n\r\nJack\r\n",

            "body": "A little bit more explanation. \r\n\r\nSince I do not know how familiar readers are with the source code, let me put into two sections: section I --- single device, section II --- multidevices. Since before fully understands the mechanism of current single device, there is no point to talk about extension to multidevices.\r\n\r\nsuppose 2 users: user A with two devices(device_a1, device_a2), user X with 1 single device(device_x).\r\n\r\nSection I --- single device.\r\n\r\ndevice_x(of User X) announce the dhtpk which the user X wants to use. The user X should send this announce to user A. This announcement is the 0x9C message, which is wrapped into 0x85 message.\r\nNow the detail: this 0x85 message is not sent to device_a(of User A), but to a point P which is \"close\" to PK_A. P then turns 0x85 message into 0x86 message and sends 0x86 message to user A.\r\n\r\nBefore device_x sends 0x85(0x9C) message to P, device_x asked P whether P can forward messages to user A. device_x asked P with message 0x83, P responded with message 0x84. P can respond with yes/no. If P responded yes, then user A must have had made the arrangement. the arrangement request is 0x83 message, and P responds with 0x84 message.\r\n\r\nNow it is the time to investigate the structure/format of 0x83,0x84,0x85,0x86, and 0x9C messages in chronical order as follows.\r\n\r\nUser A arranges message forwarding with P with 0x83 message, user A has to send 0x83 message twice.\r\nfirst time with pingid==0, 2nd time with right pindid. pindid is generated by P.\r\nkey parameter: the PK of user A(pkTargetReal, i.e. PK_A)\r\nresponse 0x84: indicator==0 means not arranged, indicator==2 means arranged.\r\n\r\nUser X asks P whether P can forward messages to user A with 0x83 message\r\nkey parameter: the PK of user A(pkTargetReal)\r\nresponse 0x84: indicator==0 means not able to forward, indicator==1 means being able to forward\r\n\r\nuser X announce its dhtpk with 0x9C message,\r\nkey parameter: dhtpk\r\nfor security reason, this message will be wrapped into 0x85 message.\r\n\r\nUser X sends 0x85 message to P\r\n2 key parameters: PK of user A, X has to tell P where to forward\r\nPK of user X, once user A received the message, the user A must know who is sending this.\r\nBy the way for security reason, 0x85 is wrapped into 0x80, 0x81, and 0x82(i.e. the onion) to reach P.\r\n\r\nP processes 0x85 message, turns it to 0x86, and sends 0x86 to user A.\r\nBy the way 0x86 is sent to user A through 0x8C(0x8D(0x8E)) message.\r\n\r\nThrough the above process, the map between DHTPK and realPK(userID) is established.\r\nWhen the user X wants to change DHTPK, the user X can go throught the above process again.\r\n\r\nSection II -- multiple devices\r\n\r\nIn the section I, wheverver the userIDs take place, should be replaced for(with) userID and deviceID(a string will be good), and default single device is the case of empty deviceID. And wherever the dhtpk takes place, should be replaced for(with) dhtpk and deviceID.\r\n\r\nWith these replacement, the map between (deviceID,DHTPK) and (userID,deviceID) is established.\r\n\r\nWhen user X asks P whether P can forward messages to user A, P responds with 0x84.\r\nthis 0x84 should tells P user X that P can forward messages to device_a1 and device_a2.\r\n\r\nHope what I presented is understandable.\r\nJack",

We can continue discussing the ideas on the pull request with the design doc.\r\n\r\nIf it is wiki, yes, I can participate. and I can learn a bit from example. Seems that I am not able to formulate a proposal in the form of a design document. I feel what I suggest is a simple thing(just a little extension), there is no need to have a design document.\r\n\r\nI think that the little extension I proposed is easy to understand if you understand the mechanism to be extended. So maybe what is needed is an explanation of the original mechanism. \r\n\r\nI can write a word or pdf document, or html document. \r\n\r\nJack\r\n",
