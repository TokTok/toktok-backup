    "body": "At the moment, every client implements an own system how to save aliases for contacts. Because every client should support aliases (they are really important because of how Tox works), it would makes sense to add it to the .tox file.\n\nIf you use client X with aliases and export the Tox profile because you'd like to use it on another device, everybody expect that the names in the contact list are the same as before. But that's not the case currently.\n\nPros:\n:white_check_mark: It will be much easier for client developers to implement alias support\n:white_check_mark: Because of the consistent save system, import/export of a profile will be easier and more comfortable for the users\n:white_check_mark: Global alias support and no client patchwork rug solution\n:white_check_mark: Toxic gets alias support -> https://github.com/JFreegman/toxic/issues/382\n\n---\n\nAs far as I can remember, @JFreegman agreed to implement it when he has time. :) Unfortunately, he didn't start because there was no chance to get it in irungentoo/toxcore. But because we have a new repository now, it's time to discuss it again, I think.\n",

Aliases can be implemented on top of toxcore, so they not necessarily should be implemented in toxcore, they can be implemented in either a client or as a separate C library that all clients use. If implemented in clients, some kind of standardization would be needed, so that clients all agree on a export/import format of the aliases (and perhaps what aliases are and how they should be implemented). As for a library, there has been an idea for a high-level/extra client library that implements some goodies on top of toxcore, making life of client developers easier. This could be one of the things that library could do.\n",

That library would then exfract the bare .tox file from the .bla file and on each change of the .tox file keep both in sync.\nThis would require that the lib is aware of all changes that are being performed. But that is a minimal change tomtoxcore or none at all if done well, and yet you'd get a single file that you can use for migrating and backing up not only your own keys and contacts, but a lot of additional information, like profile data, nicknames, notes, .....without changing and bloating toxcore.\n",

If one doesn't care about what the end user wants, the whole point of creating software is useless. Except you create it only for yourself.\n2. In the .tox file the contacts are already saved! The .tox file is actually your profile. And if you transfer your .tox file WITH your contacts you expect that the aliases are transferred too.\n3. To (optionally) add the alias to the matching Tox ID in the .tox file improves UX a lot because profile import/export is much easier. And: From my point of view, the alias is definitely **not client info!** It's global information needed for the user to use Tox in a better way.\n",

Not that performance really matters in this case, that's just FYI. Native support for [C FFI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ffi.html) is where things are at. Meaning, you have safe Rust code and C interface that you can work with.\n\n### Interface exposed by lib\n\nI was thinking about 4-5 functions exposed by lib.\n\n``` rust\n/// Returns `false if not toxj data or unsupported version.\npub fn is_toxj(bytes: &[u8]) -> bool;\n\npub fn decode_client_data(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;\n\npub fn encode_data(toxcore_data: &[u8], client_data: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;\n\npub fn decode_toxcore_data(bytes: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8>;\n```\n\nThat could be a Rust version, `client_data` possibly could be of type `Json`, in which case there would be a failure if data provided by client to the lib wouldn't be json. But perhaps binary data is fine too.\n\nDon't worry, on top of Rust API the C FFI would be layered on, with all the horrible stuff that C requires.\n\n## Data flow\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/zetok/7d670045bf0f999395ec2ebee5a8b77c (gh doesn't like embedding .svg)\n([rust-powered](https://github.com/ivanceras/svgbobrus))\n\n## Opinions?\n",

(…)\n\nSince I'm implementing the current toxcore file format in zetox, I just gotta say this: it's a bad idea to try to extend it.\n\nIt should be burned with fire instead. Sadly, due to backwards compatibility requirement that won't happen.\n\nInstead, slow & graceful replacement has to happen, and proposed by me idea should help with that.\n\nAny other ideas how that could be achieved?\n",
