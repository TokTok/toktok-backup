    "body": "Thanks to @jackiszhp for referring in #1108 to the detail of the onion\r\nprotocol which leads to the problem discussed below.\r\n\r\nWhen Alice wishes to connect to Bob, she first finds via the onion a node,\r\nEve, on which Bob is announced. Alice then sends to Eve an onion data packet\r\nas the payload of a data to route request. The onion data packet contains\r\nAlice's long-term pubkey, and it is encrypted to the data pubkey. This data\r\npubkey is provided to Alice by Eve.\r\n\r\nThe intention is that the data pubkey was previously generated by Bob and sent\r\nto Eve in Bob's announce request. However, there is nothing to prevent the\r\nEve generating her own pubkey and sending that to Alice as the data pubkey.\r\n\r\nThe result is that Eve is able to obtain Alice's long-term pubkey. Meanwhile,\r\nshe also knows Bob's long-term pubkey. So, she has determined that the two\r\npubkeys are friends. This is something the onion was intended to prevent.\r\n\r\nNote also that Eve can position herself to be used as an announce node by Bob,\r\nby generating an appropriate DHT key.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this problem was introduced by commit 639b37de.\r\n",
