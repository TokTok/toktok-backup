    "body": "#93 spawned a discussion around whether we should expose internal APIs to clients to give more control.\n## Where we are now.\n\nWe already split the library into 8 layers:\n1. `crypto`, containing some abstractions for the libsodium crypto functions\n2. `network`, basic networking abstractions (e.g. packet kind callbacks)\n3. `dht`, the distributed hash table\n4. `netcrypto`, containing TCP, onion, and net_crypto (basic encrypted end to end connections)\n5. `friends`, friend connections and requests\n6. `messenger`, almost all toxcore messenger functionality such as messages, typing notifications, and file transfers\n7. `group`, old group chats built on top of (and a little integrated in) messenger\n8. `toxcore`, the public API shim on top of everything\n\nCurrently, these layers are somewhat separated, and indeed don't call functions from layers above them, but some do have some knowledge of layers above them. Also, `netcrypto` is a bit large, containing all of TCP, onion, and net_crypto, because these three form a dependency cycle.\n## Where do we want to go?\n\nIf we want to expose internal APIs to clients, I would like to have clear interfaces between these layers and use them in the upper layers. Ideally, we would apidsl-generate each layer's public interface. That interface can then be used by clients (linking e.g. libtoxdht and using `#include <tox/dht.h>`). We would also use that public API in e.g. the netcrypto layer. For example, we would no longer directly access struct members, but instead expose APIs for all the things we want to be able to do.\n## What does the future hold?\n\nWhen we have well-defined APIs like that, we can write tests against them, and since we only depend on the public API of each layer, that layer can be swapped out for an alternative implementation (e.g. in Rust or Haskell) or a mock for testing.\n",

That would mean that upper layers won't be able to allocate those structs on stack anymore, requiring heap allocations and deallocations (malloc/free), which are costly and their cost can add up very quickly depending on frequency of the calls.\n\n(Another concern with the explicit free() being required is that you might forget to free some things, causing memory leaks, but I think this should be relatively easy to find with the code reviews, asan and some other tools, so this concern might not be as important).\n\nThis is a good idea API-wise, but I wonder how that would affect performance -- if it doesn't affect performance that much, it's good, if it does -- we might want to think about it a little more.\n",
