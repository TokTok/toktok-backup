Let's see...\r\n toxme.io is running so\r\n oh wiw\r\n wow*\r\n [2152112.531883] Out of memory: Kill process 3782 (tox-bootstrapd) score 893 or sacrifice child\r\n [2152112.643896] oom_reaper: reaped process 3782 (tox-bootstrapd), now anon-rss:0kB, file-rss:0kB, shmem-rss:0kB\r\n\r\n If so many went offline at that time I would imagine someone caused a leak to manifest in tox bootstrap daemon took down several nodes with it that way\r\n nurupo: node started but yeah I'm pretty sure this wouldn't have been random. I doubt we all started our nodes exactly at the same time so it must have been someone doing something with the network that caused bootstrap nodes to die\r\n<nurupo> are you sure it was tox-bootstrapd that filled up your ram and not some other program?\r\n<LittleVulpix> nurupo: not minding the fact the same happened to several completely unrelated machines, yeah I'm pretty sure\r\n [2152112.531817] [ pid ]   uid  tgid total_vm      rss nr_ptes nr_pmds swapents oom_score_adj name\r\n [2152112.531846] [ 3782]   999  3782   467797   455738     903       4        0             0 tox-bootstrapd\r\n  467MB ram\r\n  reserved\r\n  455 actually used\r\n  normal resource usage is about 10-15MB RAM from what I remember\r\n  soooo that's like 45x as much\r\n<iphy> LittleVulpix: interesting\r\n<nurupo> if there is a memory leak then it's likely to be in toxcore itself so every tox node (i.e. even a client), i don't think there is anything in tox-bootstrapd that can leak memory, so everything that uses toxcore is likely affected, even clients. also, a lot of nodes were using old toxcore, like irungentoo old, so if there is a memory leak issue - it must be long present\r\n<iphy> yes\r\n```\r\n\r\n![nodes8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/467709/46196675-6703de80-c310-11e8-87a9-06c1438d8171.png)\r\n",
