    "body": "Hey toxcore devs.\r\n\r\nI've been toying recently with the idea of a couple protocol extensions. For example in qTox I'd like the ability to properly show code blocks, or share custom smileys with a friend, or be able to pack multiple messages together into one.\r\n\r\nAll of these things currently I cannot do without hooking into the custom packet type, but that got me thinking that it would be quite hard to coordinate with other clients and could ruin the experience when interacting with other clients.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that a decent solution to this would be to have a way of telling a friend which extensions you support and doing some form of client negotiation, to accomplish this I wanted to write a simple library (API design is not very flushed out yet due to my uncertainty that it would be accepted by the community). This library would wrap the custom packet type and have a slimmed down api along the lines of\r\n\r\ntypedef void(*extension_callback_fn)(int friend_id, char* data);\r\nint register_extension(char* extension_uuid, extension_callback_fn);\r\nint send_extension_data(char* extension_uuid, int friend_id, char* extension_data);\r\nint check_friend_extension(char* extension_uuid, int friend_id);\r\n\r\nWould this type of library be against the tox way? If I started then implementing extensions on top of this library would I be stepping on anyone's toes?\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!",
