So as I regularly create test ToxIDs and add them it is continuously changing, but since a lot of my contacts don't come online I have to do an individual announcement to them.\r\n\r\nI could not find any sentences describing any privacy improvements with shared announcements.\r\n\r\nI argue, that it may not be worth the complexity and possible security implications to use shared announcements for user clients over individual announcements for a reduction of 50 to 35 announcement locations. I think this could be useful for bots since they probably need to purge offline friends more aggressively anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n> We send Data Search requests once every 3 seconds to nodes on our list which we are not announced to, and once every 120 seconds to those we are announced to.\r\n\r\nAgain, are these fixed or optimal values? Because 3 seconds sounds like a no-go for ever trying to use the DHT on mobile directly. Is there a reason we need to announce this often?\r\n\r\n> Migration\r\n\r\nI prefer the smooth road here. I think it will be really hard to convince users to switch \"all at once\". Would it be possible to gather statistics at e.g. some popular bots about the distribution of \"old\" vs \"new\" lookup traffic? If so, we could use this as a metric when to turn of the old system once enough people have migrated, but I guess this will be in the range of 1-2 years :/\r\n\r\n",

Getting IPs of friends of friends is possible anyway, though. \nEasiest alternative way, assuming you're on the DHT: attacker positions \nthemself near your DHT key and listens for searches for your DHT key, \nwhich friends make in the process of connecting to you.\n\n>since a lot of my contacts don't come online I have to do an individual \n>announcement to them.\n\nYes, that is a problem. I don't have a nice solution.\n\nOne not nice solution would be to try to communicate to the user that \nthere are bandwidth costs associated to their inactive friends, so they \ncan choose to delete them if this worries them. Another would be to \nautomatically stop announcing to / searching for them after a period of \ninactivity (a year?), again communicating this to the user somehow and \nletting them override it.\n\nAnother, not really a solution at all, would be to not automatically \nregenerate the shared key on deleting a friend, but rather give the user \nthe option to do so, and communicate to them why they might want to do \nso (which is because if they don't, the ex-friend could still determine \ntheir IP address at any future time) and why they might not (bandwidth). \nFor example, rather than actually delete friends you could first \"block\" \nthem (no change in shared key) then as a separate step \"purge\" blocked \nfriends (meaning regenerating the shared key), with the explanations \nbeing associated with this purge option. I don't much like the idea of \nencouraging less than maximally privacy-preserving behaviour this way, \nthough.\n\nAnother partial solution would be to just announce less vigorously for \nlong-inactive friends, on the basis that it's possibly not so much of \na problem if they don't reliably find you quickly. Maybe just by \nreducing the number of nodes announced to. In theory, you could even \nannounce just at a single node and still be found. What do you think of \nthat?\n\n>I could not find any sentences describing any privacy improvements with \n>shared announcements.\n\nThere are none, it's purely for efficiency.\n\n>I argue, that it may not be worth the complexity and possible security \n>implications to use shared announcements\n\nI don't think there are security implications, properly understood. Tox \ncan not protect the information of which IP addresses are friends with \nwhich.\n\nIt does involve some complexity, but I think it's worth it.\n\n>I think this could be useful for bots since they probably need to purge \n>offline friends more aggressively anyway.\n\nWhy useful? Anyway, bots would probably want to use the public \nannouncements system rather than shared announcements.\n\n>> We send Data Search requests once every 3 seconds to nodes on our \n>> list which we are not announced to, and once every 120 seconds to \n>> those we are announced to.\n>\n>Again, are these fixed or optimal values? Because 3 seconds sounds like \n>a no-go for ever trying to use the DHT on mobile directly. Is there \n>a reason we need to announce this often?\n\nThis is copied directly from the onion. The idea is that you search \nrapidly like this until you get close enough to the target key that you \nfind nodes who will accept your announcements. The only problem is if \none of the 8 closest nodes refuses the announcement, because it's full \nor uncooperative. I guess there should be a backoff system to handle \nthat case - say linear backoff as with searches, up to a max of 120s?\n\n>> Migration\n>\n>I prefer the smooth road here. I think it will be really hard to \n>convince users to switch \"all at once\". Would it be possible to gather \n>statistics at e.g. some popular bots about the distribution of \"old\" vs \n>\"new\" lookup traffic?\n\nYeah, that should be straightforward.\n\n>If so, we could use this as a metric when to turn of the old system \n>once enough people have migrated, but I guess this will be in the range \n>of 1-2 years :/\n\nYeah. I guess one question to ask is: since we know the onion doesn't \nserve its purpose (#1121), would we really be doing right by users if we \nencouraged them to keep using it?\n",

Thus creating the illusion of it doing something good, and delaying iteration on a feature that we actually need, like meaningful and usable friend finding?\r\n\r\nContext:\r\nBecause The onion, can't really even be used to obscure the source IP in friend requests past the first connection. We should drop the onion, and just make friend requests public the same way meeting requests are. People who need IP obscurity can still tunnel tox through tor as they should be doing already. \r\n\r\nUsers who don't want friend requests, can use one time use IDs they can give to friends, or make \"public\", and their \"real long term key\" if they don't care about friend requests being public.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, friend requests are CURRENTLY complicated, and IMO out of scope for this issue.

Even if someone does expose your ToxID, if you never go looking for it, no one on the network would ever be able to learn your real IP.
