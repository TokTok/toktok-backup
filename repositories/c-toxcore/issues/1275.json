If I'm right, it should \nbe fixed in #1267.\n\nMy theory is that the problem was that your public key somehow ended up \nappearing twice in the list of peers and frozen peers, with different \npeer numbers. That shouldn't be possible in #1267, but in current master \nit could have happened if you accepted two different invites to the same \ngroup, for example. The saving code implicitly assumed that this didn't \nhappen, and wrote something unloadable if it did. I've just pushed \na commit to #1267 which removes that assumption.\n\nSo: could you try #1267 and report back, preferably with a corrupted \nsave file, if you run into a problem again?\n\nThanks for the report, in any case!\n",
