If I'm right about the \ncause, the problem is that they are telling you the title of that group, \nbut doing so before they know your group number for the group, so using \nthe default value of 0 instead, causing your client to understand them \nas having changed the title of group 0. Your client will honour this \nrequest if it is trying to reconnect in group 0 to that peer.\n\nThis fits your symptoms if I understand them correctly. I expect the PR \nwill fix this bug. Certainly it fixes an error in the code, so should be \nmerged in any case, but it would be good to confirm that it fixes this \nbug. So if it's feasible for you to get your friends to use the PR \nversion so you can test it, that would be great.\n",
