I'm interested in working on the core protocol and am not so interested in the clients (yet).\r\n\r\nI had considerable difficulty with qTox and tuntox establishing P2P UDP connections and I'm trying to find out if this is a problem with the c-toxcore, or the clients.  It seems to work fine between qTox and my client though.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, sending ytalk-like character by character is relatively easy, and I can demo it if anybody is interested but this isn't a change in the core protocol, it's a change in the client.  I'm coding under Linux, and I'm basing it off the echo_bot in the wiki.  I can only work with it during my time off.\r\n\r\nI'll make a simple curses based client over time, then I'll move it up to probably QT later.  There's a lot of features I would like to add to the core - for example, I should be able to identify with the client if I'm connected P2P or to a relay, also identify the IP address when connected to either.",

FUSE is perfect for this.  If you are under Linux or Mac, check out sshfs if you've never used it.  It's wonderful and I will never, ever setup samba or nfs again even though it lacks some features of those file systems.  It was written by the same guy that did FUSE.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I'm getting off topic, so I better shut up.  Thanks for the pointer.",

With Windows (and probably android and iPhone) this may not be useful, but under Linux and Mac, it would allow you to mount a friend's file system as if it's a NAS.  The friend would determine what directories you have access to and what permissions you would have - maybe read only, maybe write as well - could be write only though that's a little bit of a trick.\r\n\r\nWith more primitive operating systems, like Windows, you'd still be able to copy and write to the file system, but it wouldn't be seamless like it would be under a Unix like OS.  It MIGHT be possible under Android and IOS, but frankly, I don't much care about them at this point in time, as I'm not very competent in coding them.\r\n\r\nIf you've never used it and you're on a Un*x system, try firing up SSHFS.  It's a simple, elegant way to connect to a remote computer as if it's a USB flash drive.  I use it all the time now.  My computer at work is mounted to my computer at home, and vice versa.  Does away with my need to use X2Go since both machines have nearly identical setups.",

It might take some experimentation to see how \nlong the lag can be before it starts interfering with natural \ncommunication, but my guess would be that sending one packet per 250ms \nwould be fine. So each of your keystrokes appears at the other end \n[250ms + network delay] after you type them (but should appear on your \nscreen immediately).\n\nBeyond that, I think classic unix talk clients had things figured out.\n\nParticipants be allowed to have different screen widths, so I recommend \nhaving logical lines of arbitrary length which are wrapped by the \nclient. You can edit the current line only, with ^H/bkspace and ^W and \n^U understood correctly, terminated with ^M/^J.\n\nI'd say a fixed-width font should be used by default (for ascii-art \npurposes), but I suppose this can be left to clients.\n\nAnyway, as Anthony Bilinski says, this isn't really something which \nshould go in toxcore itself. It looks like a perfect test case for \ntoxext.\n\nIf you are interested in helping out on c-toxcore though, that would be \ngreat! Saying hello in #toktok on irc.freenode.net is probably the best \nway to get started.\n",
