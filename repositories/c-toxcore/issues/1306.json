When asked about when does toxcore delete peers from the offline peer list, @zugz has said that it doesn't, that it grows indefinitely and that its growth is not limited in toxcore, meaning it can be used to DOS a target user or an entire conference.",

It would also be nice to add an API function for deleting offline peers, so that users could manually delete offline peers, e.g. ones that haven't been online in ages. Offline peers also need an API call akin to `tox_friend_get_last_online()`, so that clients could automate deletion of offline peers based on how long they have been offline. The \"last online\" information might also be useful for the mentioned earlier toxcore's auto-deletion functionality where toxcore removes offline peers when their count exceed a certain number, so that toxcore could delete the oldest ones first (though \"last seen\" info might be useless for toxcore if it already stored the peers in the last seen order). Though favoring the peers who just recently went offline can be exploited to deny the persistent conference feature, so perhaps toxcore should remove offline peers at random? On the other hand, peers that haven't been online for long are not very likely to come back, so there is less value in keeping them...Not sure that removal strategy is the best.",
