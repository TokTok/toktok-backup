    "body": "Hi. I'm sorry if this is not suitable site to post about this, but I did not find other better place.\r\n\r\nDear currently tox has problem regarding support for Android. Antidote seem to be dead application now. Last release was 3 years ago & Antidote currently available in Google play is very buggy .... This is great shortage !\r\n\r\nRecently I discovered new application for Android called Tok for Android - see:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.tok.life/\r\nhttps://github.com/InsightIM\r\n\r\nBut I'm suspicions about it's safety & trust because:\r\n\r\n1) you did not mention it on your official page:\r\nhttps://tox.chat/clients.html\r\n\r\n2) it use Tor by default & not allow it's optional use. It seem that it use build in Tor ! I'm not sure is this okay or not. May be I'm wrong in this point ?\r\n\r\n3) there is some thing in their \"Privacy policy\" which bring my attention & make me post this issue.\r\nIt said:\r\n\"Exceptions you have to know: In some situations Tok can't establish a direct, peer-to-peer, connection with the recepients (e.g.restrictive NATs, TCP mode, HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy), in which cases Tok uses a relay node or proxy. Note that the relay node or proxy can't decrypt contents of messages and audio/video calls, as they are not the intended recepient of those.\"\r\nIs this - use of proxy in certain cases without making user select to agree or not before do this - is on spirit of Tox ?? The problem is that they not make this optional to user to decide either to disable this behaviour ....... \r\n\r\n4) they fork you !! They fork c-toxcore itself  !! See:\r\nhttps://github.com/InsightIM/c-toxcore\r\n\r\nPlease can you help by given your kind opinion about this new application ?  Can you verify safety & trust of this new application ? I'm not programer & can not understand their code ......",

It does not allow import Tox ID ! ...... It seem that it will remain so & will not evoluted to mature application. I test Tok-Android & it notify me when someone send me IM or voice message or image .... Currently Tok-Android has no audio/video chat but it seem that when they added in feature they will work well also. I'm concerned about safety & trust of it due to points that I already mentioned .....\r\n\r\nPlease can you examine code of Tok-Android &  verify if it is safe & trusted or not ?",

However, the fork's source does not correspond to those included in Tok-iOS (and apparently Tok-Android).\r\n\r\nTok-Android's source code is not completely open. It does not contain the source code of its fork of c-toxcore, thus violating c-toxcore's GPLv3.\r\nTok-Android's version string is \"1.0.0\" in the source code; however, the Play Store version is already 1.1.2. \r\n\r\nTok-iOS includes a copy of modified c-toxcore source code. After further investigation, it is based on [TokTok/c-toxcore@a5cd4764aa3e5f8f0ba18d8348f5995d255f6c00](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/commit/a5cd4764aa3e5f8f0ba18d8348f5995d255f6c00). This commit is already more than 8 months ago and might contain security issues. \r\n\r\nTok-iOS's developers have added \"group\" and \"offline message\" functionalities into c-toxcore. After reviewing c-toxcore included in Tok-iOS, these additional functions are all based on centralized \"group bot\" and \"offline message bot\". Since these bots are not part of Tox's protocol, these changes are probably incompatible with other Tox clients. Centralized bots are single point of failure and do not meet Tox's point of decentralization. They also reduce anonymity and increase risks of leaking IP, personal data, etc.\r\n\r\nPersonally the code quality of the modified c-toxcore in Tok-iOS is not good. :)\r\n\r\nThese are the issues I can find currently.\r\n",
