It is entirely possible for the group to split into \nmultiple equally valid components, then later merge. Suppose we have the \nfollowing friend relations: (A,B), (D,E), (B,C), (C,D). All 5 join \na group together, then all quit. Later, A,B,D,E all come online. Then \nA and B will see each other in the group, as, separately, will D and E. \nThese two subgroups might each change the title. Then C turns up, and \nthe group merges into one. What title should be seen by whom?\n\nVoting won't help here, as it's a tie. If we stored timestamps, we could \nsay the last to change wins, or the first to change wins. But either is \narbitrary, and someone is going to get annoyed when their title gets \nchanged on them.\n\nThe way it currently works: when you join/rejoin the group, you take the \ntitle from whoever is bringing you into the group; after that, you only \nconsider the title to have changed if you actually see someone changing \nit.\n\nThe seemingly random behaviour in your example illustrates a (common) \nedge case: when C is left alone in the group and then A arrives, both \nconsider themselves to be rejoining the group, and so it is indeed \nbasically random which title gets chosen (depends which packet wins the \nrace). Actually, I wonder if they end up just swapping titles... that \nwould sound like a bug.\n\nIn general, with the current system, group members might well disagree \non the title.\n\nMaybe storing timestamps and using the most recent would be a sensible \nsolution. It would mean adding to the protocol though, and some ugliness \nto keep backwards compatibility (sending the title both with and without \na timestamp).\n\nIf we just wanted to enforce a consensus and didn't care about it making \nsense, we could just strcmp the titles and have the earliest always win. \nNo need for a protocol change that way!\n\nThis isn't the only problem like this with these groups, by the way. \nIt's also possible for a name change not to get properly propagated.

Current groups are not meant to protect from malicious users anyway, so I think that's no issue.\r\n- A wrongly propagated old title will be discarded, so it fixes itself after some time. Instead of currently passing around old titles infinitely.\r\n\r\nThe drawbacks:\r\n- If a user runs on a wrong clock he can fuck up the system. IMO not very common case.\r\n- Deliberate modifications are easy\r\n- If two parts of a group merge, one side will be confused.

Set it to 1. \nIf the byte doesn't appear, the packet is considered as version 0. Note \nthe current code doesn't check the length of the packet, and will just \nignore this byte.\n\nWhen responding to version >=1 such packets, in place of the \nPEER_TITLE_ID direct packet, send a new timestamped title direct packet \ncontaining the current title and the timestamp we have stored for the \ntitle.\n\nOn receiving such a packet, update the title and its timestamp to those \nreceived if the timestamp is greater than the currently stored \ntimestamp. In case of ties, use strcmp on the titles.\n\nIf we receive an old-style PEER_TITLE_ID packet... I guess continue to \nuse the current \"title_fresh\" criterion for accepting it, but set the \ntimestamp to 0 if we do.\n\nSave and load timestamps along with titles. The initial timestamp on the \n(null) title of a newly created group is 0.\n\nWhen we receive a GROUP_MESSAGE_TITLE_ID message, set the title and set \nthe timestamp to the current unix time according to *our* clock (even if \nthis is earlier than the current timestamp).\n\nUsing the receiver's clock rather than the sender's may seem odd, but as \nwell as meaning the protocol doesn't need to change as much, I think it \nhandles better the case that some participant's clock is erroneously \nlate; this way the winning title will basically be the last one that \nparticipant saw, whereas if we used sender timestamps it would tend to \nbe the last one that participant set.\n\nOne nasty possibility: if a peer with a late clock disconnects and the \ntitle is changed while they're gone, they might persist with their last \nseen title when they rejoin, because they reckon it to be the most \nrecent. I don't see a cheap way to handle this. I hope it's acceptable?\n\nThings won't work particularly nicely when only some of the peers speak \nthis new protocol. But it shouldn't be too bad.\n\nBTW, accessing the system clock is something that's also needed for \n#1260.\n",

I have a few questions about the current implementation though and depending on their answer I think we can improve the protocol a bit\r\n\r\n- When does the current implementation send the `GROUP_MESSAGE_TITLE_ID` message? Only when changing the title, or also when connecting to the group?\r\n  - if it's only when changing the title, we could ignore the `PEER_TITLE_ID` packet from old clients, thus in a mixed group the title would stay sane when others connect\r\n\r\n> When responding to version >=1 such packets, in place of the PEER_TITLE_ID direct packet, send a new timestamped title direct packet containing the current title and the timestamp we have stored for the title.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to respond with the title timestamp plus the current time on the side which sends the new `PEER_TITLE_ID` packet. This way the receiver can sync their clock to \"group time\" on connection.\r\n\r\nI think this also means we don't need the absolute wall clock at all.",

E.g. how would the protocol react if `Alice` (old) introduces `Bob` (new) to the group. Then `Bob` would accept the title from `Alice`, but would set the time to 0. Now `Carol` (new) connects via `Bob`, but has a title with a more recent time stamp. Should `Carol`:\r\n1. ignore the title from `Bob`\r\n2. send a title change notification with her title to the group\r\n\r\n1) would result in `Carol` having a newer title, but don't displaying it. 2) would result in that `Bob` now thinks `Carols` title is the most current, even though maybe `Dave` has an even newer title, but is offline atm.\r\n\r\nWriting this I'm not even sure if it's possible to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n> How would you keep this \"group time\" synchronized through splits and rejoins?

No need to sync anything, because on the next title change we store the timestamp also in local time.\r\n\r\nA possible drawback might be, that there is an accumulating error due to network delay and different clocks, but this should not matter as it's synced once a group title change occurs.",

            "body": "* Thursday, 2019-07-25 at 10:22 -0700 - sudden6 <notifications@github.com>:\n\n>Would it be possible to ask different group members for the title, \n>until one has the new protocol or we tried all?\n\nThe only way to do this which really fits the protocol is to send \na group message to the whole group, and have every member reply. That \nmeans a lot of traffic, so I think we should try to avoid it. \n\n>Thought some more about it and I propose to send the difference to wall \n>clock time in the `PEER_TITLE_ID` v2 packet.\n\nThat's a nice idea. But without an absolute time, we don't know when the \ncurrent title+time is equal to one we are sent, which causes problems in \nthe protocol.\n\nSo I think we should stick with unix time timestamps. We can deal \nreasonably well with bad clocks as follows: when setting a new title, we \nset the stamp to be the current time according to our clock or, if it's \ngreater, the old stamp plus 1. So if someone with a broken clock sets \na stamp that's in the future, or if we have many title changes in quick \nsuccession, we degenerate to incrementing version numbers for a while. \n\nOK, so here's a reworked version of the detailed protocol proposed \nearlier (which was horribly incomplete).\n\nI'll first ignore the problem of backwards compatibility, and assume all \npeers implement the new protocol, then later discuss changes to handle \nold clients.\n\nFirst, a terminological matter. For futureproofing purposes, I suggest \nwe replace everywhere \"title\" with \"shared group state\" (or \"state\" for \nshort). For now this state will in fact just consist of a title, but we \ncould imagine eventually extending it to copy some of the irc-like \nfunctionality of NGC to these groups. I don't know if we'll ever want \nto, but it doesn't hurt to prepare the ground a little. (Note that \nmoderation would actually work with these groups, since we can \nban/devoice by Tox ID, and joining is by invitation only.)\n\nA \"timestamped state\" is a state together with a timestamp. To determine \nwhich of two timestamped states is \"newer\": first compare the \ntimestamps, then use strcmp on the titles to break ties.\n\nAs previously, we adapt the Peer Query packet to include a version, and \npeers implementing the new protocol will reply with a new packet I'll \nnow call the \"State Response\" packet, containing a timestamped state.\n\nAlso add a new kind of group message, the \"State message\" containing \na timestamped state.\n\nOn receiving a State Response packet with a timestamped state different \nfrom our current timestamped state:\nIf the received timestamped state is newer, update our copy of the state \nand send a State message with the new timestamped state. Otherwise (note \nin this case the received timestamped state is older), send back a State \nResponse packet with our current timestamped state.\n\nOn receiving a State message, update our timestamped state if the \nreceived one is newer.\n\n\n# Analysis\n\nAssume all peers implement this protocol.\n\nThe \"connected component\" of a peer is the closure under transitivity of \ndirect connections, i.e. the peers to whom a message sent by the peer \nwould be received.\n\nClaim: A peer will always have their timestamped state set to the newest \ntimestamped state amongst those seen by the peers in their connected \ncomponent. (BUT: see Proviso below)\n\nIndeed, assume inductively that this is true of all components, and \nsuppose two peers A and B become connected. At least one of the two will \nsend a Peer Query packet to the other; say A sends one to B. So B sends \na State Response back to A. If B's component has newer timestamped state \nthan A's, then A will send a State message with the newer one, and so \nA's component will update. If A's component has newer timestamped state, \nA will send a State Response to B, and then as above B's component will \nupdate.\n\nProviso: the above is severely oversimplified, because updates are not \nin fact atomic operations, so one has to consider the dynamics of \npropagation of the messages and merges and splits and further updates \nduring the propagation. I believe it does work in general, but it's not \nso easy to reason about precisely.\n\n\n# Backwards compatibility\n\nIt's true that if A or B in the above are using an old client, the \nsynchronisation will fail. There are things we could add to try to deal \nwith this, but it would be messy. But actually: since the only \nproblematic versions of toxcore would be those since the (fairly recent) \nintroduction of persistent groups, perhaps it isn't too bad to just \nignore the problem?\n\nTo handle the more general problem of peers using the legacy unstamped \nmechanism to set titles, we could do the following: if we receive \na Title message with a title which isn't that in our current state, \nupdate our state with the title and *increment* the timestamp. So the \npeers using the new protocol will agree on a timestamped state \ncontaining the new title.\nWhen we set a new title, send a Title message after the State message \n(some peers may receive them in the other order, but that's ok).\n\nWhen we're first introduced to a group, if the introducer is using the \nold protocol so sends us just a title but no timestamped state, put the \ntitle in the state but leave the timestamp at 0.\n\n\n# Meta\n\nAlthough I'm perverse enough to have found writing the above a fairly \namusing way to spend an evening, we should really ask ourselves whether \nit makes sense to keep working on this implementation of groups.\nWe may end up replacing them with entirely with NGC.\n\nAre these synchronisation problems already solved in the private groups \nin NGC? The description in the spec doesn't seem to discuss it at all.\n\nSame question for the public groups, actually -- according to the \ndescription, it seems to just be assuming that periodically checking on \nthe DHT will be enough to prevent netsplits, which sounds optimistic?\n",
