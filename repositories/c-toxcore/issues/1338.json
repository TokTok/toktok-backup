It sends some packets to you node and checks if it gets the correct response back. If it's in a private network, you can telnet into your node `telnet <ip> 33445` to at least make sure there is something accepting TCP connections on there (I guess nmap works too).\r\n\r\nAnyway, from what you have described it sounds like your tox-boostrapd node should have no issues with receiving TCP connections, so make sure that qTox is actually attempting to connect to it through TCP. You might want to open an issue at https://github.com/qTox/qTox and have qTox folks help you figure out why qTox is not connecting to the node if you have hard time troubleshooting it yourself.",
