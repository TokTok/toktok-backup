    "body": "On the POTS (plain old telephone system - seriously, that's an industry term) the maximum latency in audio permitted was 1/10th of a second.  If it's longer than that people will step on each other's conversation.  This is an industry standard and was a minimal requirement when ATM (asynchronous transmission mode - that's the standard digital protocol of voice over the POTS) was implemented.\r\n\r\nWhen talking to my cousin between California and Argentina, it's closer to about a full second as near as we were able to determine on Antox.  I've tested this locally between my phone (Antox) and my computer (qTox), and it's still much longer than 1/10th of a second.\r\n\r\nA very useful feature would be to measure the lag directly within the c-toxcore.  For example: audio packets should be sent, and when received, some of them (marked) and sent back to measure the audio latency so it can be reported to a higher level application.  The total round trip time should be < 0.2 seconds.  Of course the individual application running on top of c-toxcore can also add latency.\r\n\r\nWhen the lag is larger 1/4 second, rules in speaking have to start to be implemented, i.e. (over, over & out, etc).  This in my opinion is the biggest problem with tox for audio at the moment.",

I'll check the audio latency though, maybe that's \"A0:\" - that shows \"20\" constantly at least on my phone.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be possible that \"most\" android phones add 100 ms latency, every single VOIP app would fail to work properly on it - the phones I'm on certainly don't, and they aren't fancy.  I use multiple VOIP applications on my phone BTW.\r\n\r\nI will never use Skype again.  The reason I'm getting into the guts of this code, is to bury Skype.  It was a perfectly usable IM until Microsoft purchased it, and made it unusable.  Microsoft had the BRILLIANT idea of requiring me verify my Skype account - with a phone number I had in 2005, when I lived on the other side of the country.  Also, web Skype won't work under Linux  anymore, unless you start spoofing the identifier of the web-browser.  F them.\r\n\r\nTox has some minor problems, but the chief one (for me) is the audio latency.  I think that Opus is taking too long of a sample before compressing it then sending it on it's way.  It should be at maximum, maybe 70 ms of audio.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, does Antox NEED \"security\" fixes?  Unless libsodium was broken, I don't see that as likely, also, onion routing doesn't really give you much protection if you're talking about that.  The only person that could be attempting to monitor (on even something as broken as Skype) would be a global adversary - onion routing is pretty much pointless in my opinion.  Even if it works, as soon as you connect to a contact, that other contact can easily be identified.",

Because of this, connections with peers aren't directly peer to peer, and you could have a randomly geolocated volunteer TCP relay between you two, which could be a major contributor of latency.\r\n\r\nIn my testing, \"Enable UDP\" in Antox settings doesn't seem to actually work..\r\n\r\n> Incidentally, does Antox NEED \"security\" fixes?\r\n\r\nNot AFAIK. There have been security fixes released relating directly to running a TCP relays, and other relating to forming better onion routes - but normal clients do not run TCP relays, and only users using UDP form onion routes. I could be missing one?",
