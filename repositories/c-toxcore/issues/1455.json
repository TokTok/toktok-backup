    "body": "I encountered this problem while I developing my Tox client - Protox. To make things clear, two scenarios where this issue arises need to be described.\r\n \r\nScenario 1:\r\n- The friend is not online/you are not connected to the Tox network.\r\n- You send a message by calling ```tox_send_message```.\r\n- ```tox_send_message``` obviously fails and returns an error.\r\n \r\nI don't know how toxcore works, but there is no function that would wait until the friend comes online and send him the message. But that's fine, because I can implement this myself in my client. This is not in itself a problem, though, if such a function existed, it would be very developer-friendly.\r\n \r\nThe problem arises in scenario 2.\r\n \r\nScenario 2:\r\n- Your friend is online.\r\n- You disable your connection to the Internet (Wi-Fi, 4G...)\r\n- You send a message.\r\n- You enable your connection.\r\n- Your friend receives the message.\r\n \r\nYour friend remains online until toxcore figures out that you are disconnected. If you are lucky to send the message when you are offline, at least you will get an error which tells your client that it can resend that message in the future. If you are not, your friend will get that message no matter what and there is no good way to cancel it. This behavior is very unpredictable. In theory, you can destroy and re-create the Tox object but I'd rather not do that because it requires bootstrapping and this is not a correct solution.\r\n \r\nThere should be a way to cancel/prevent your message from being sent in toxcore.\r\n \r\nFor example, you can implement a simple function:\r\n```bool tox_cancel_message(Tox *tox, uint32_t friend_number, uint32_t message_id)```\r\nthat would return ```true``` on success or ```false``` if message with this id is received or does not exist.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

The unsent case should never happen, and he double send case should be very rare.\r\n\r\nqTox's behaviour to work with the network dropping issue is to:\r\n1. Send the message, remember the message and returned receipt\r\n1. When the user silently disconnects, when they reconnect they will flicker offline then online. So on online status change, we consider any still pending receipt for that friend as undelivered.\r\n1. Re-send all messages in order that we haven't received an ack for for that friend.\r\n\r\nThe only case this doesn't handle is if we send the message, the friend gets it, then disconnects before sending back the ack. In that case we assume the friend hasn't received the message because we haven't received the ack, so we will re-deliver it when we see them come back online. This could be avoided with a UID for the messages so that the receiver could drop the second copy. \r\n\r\nYou can take a look at the implementation in https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/src/persistence/offlinemsgengine.cpp",
