Easy: fetch a git commit from the support horizon (e.g. 1 month ago) and replace the test suite from the to-be-tested clone (i.e. the one cloned by Travis CI) with the old one. This validates that we're source-compatible with the version of a month ago (including internal APIs, but perhaps we could just replace the `tox*` test files, not the internal unit tests).\n2. Harder: fetch a git commit from the support horizon and build a test program with it. Build the same test program with the current code and run both of them. This test program is yet to be written, and should run some simple tests like adding each other and sending messages.\n",
