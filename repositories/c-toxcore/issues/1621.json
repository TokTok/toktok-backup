But I also read that they only support HTTP and tend to filter ads/malware/other badstuff.\n\nI tested it and i2pd could not understand the HTTP proxy protocol format toxcore speaks. (bug?!)\n\nedit: This should be reworked. Toxcore relies too strongly on IP:PORT for tcp connections and should just pass the address string to the proxy instead, that way i2p and tor hidden services would suddenly become available.\n\n## Method B: tunnels\nOne can run tox relays as hidden services. However, every user needs to manually specify each hidden service as a tunnel, so it becomes available on a local port. Annoying to setup, but should just work.\n\nDid not test.\n\n## Method C: toxcore internal network object shim\nHere we hook the low level network functions like `bind()`, `listen()`, `send()`, and `getaddrinfo()` to map i2p address to virtual local ports (or ip addresses), so basically a form of NAT. With `getaddrinfo()` hooked, the user can provide i2p addresses. This can also automate the manual process mentioned in `B`. A downside is that in udp mode, exchanged ip addresses will mean nothing to the other peers.\n\nCurrently refactoring/finishing the network object code, so this can work. #2773 \nRequires #2397 \n\n## Method D: toxcore refactor separating messenger from netcode\nThis is the long way and effectively the end goal, mentioned above.\nThis is a big task however and unlikely to happen before 0.3.x .",
