It sounds like you have some sort of misunderstanding of how packaging on Linux works. It's usually up to distribution's packagers to package the software, not the developers of the said software. If you check who maintains packages in a distribution, you would quickly notice this. For example, in Debian, the Chromium package is not maintained by the Chromium developers, the VLC package is not maintained by the VLC developers, etc. Well, it's certainly not unheard of for software developers to also double as packagers of their software, but it's more of an exception than a norm. In any case, the appropriate channel to report issues such as this, issues with how a package is packaged in a distribution, is the distribution's package bug tracker, so that the package maintainer would see the issue, not the upstream (this) bug tracker, where you contact the developers of the software.\r\n\r\nWell, I hope you have learned something!",
