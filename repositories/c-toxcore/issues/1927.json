    "body": "Hi,\r\nCould someone please advise me if there's a risk for my IP to be exposed to my connected friends when I'm using TCP-only (UDP disabled)?\r\n\r\nAs I understand, if TCP relay is used, my friends will only see the IP address of the TCP relay that they are connecting to, and will not be able to see the destination IP address. However, as my knowledge about the protocol is still shallow, will there be a possible scenario for my friend to somehow figure out my IP address?\r\n\r\nYou answer will be greatly appreciated.\r\n",

Naive users of Tor don't firewall their machines (which is hard) so then leak DNS lookups a lot, and that leaks that you are using Tox.\r\n\r\nThe c-code to do a DNS lookup over Tor is tiny: IIRC you connect to 9050 and give a specially formatted binary oneliner. I know I have python code that does it: if anyone is interested I'll look for it.\r\n\r\nIs there an issue open for DNS lookups over Tor when using Tor/SOCKS5?
