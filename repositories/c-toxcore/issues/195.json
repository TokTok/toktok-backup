We had to  disable udp to make it work, which brings the questions , is the implementation of hole-punching correct ? How do other programs holepunch without killing the (same) routers. Why do we need udp holepunching when it could first try to upnp ? The router list includes tplink netgear ZTE  thomson and others ( common routers where I live).\n\nAt least you could default udp off for now since I cant even recommend it to somone without have to be like \" Oh and you need to go uncheck that udp thing... \"\n\nMany thanks,\nLait\n",
