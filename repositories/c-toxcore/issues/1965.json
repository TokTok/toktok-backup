    "body": "TunTox seems to be a really amazing project, that allows tunneling arbitrary TCP applications through Tox.  \r\n\r\nThis kind of thing is incredibly useful, as it enables a very large class of self-hosted services to have fully-automated setup and easy sharing.\r\n\r\nWere this to be added to GUI clients, it would also provide for a way to implement advanced HTML \"profile pages\" and pull-mode filesharing, nice UIs for bots, or any other feature you might want to add, without any need for the client on the other side to explicitly support it.\r\n\r\n## User Cases/Stories\r\n\r\nI think there's enough potential uses to justify standardizing it, as it can serve as a platform for a ton of plugins, that might otherwise have to be done separately from scratch.\r\n\r\n### Mirroring \r\n\r\nA plugin could allow a node to host a caching proxy for some other site, perhaps enhanced by some kind of changelog.txt file that could eliminate crawling.\r\n\r\nOne could make a site like Wikipedia available to friends who otherwise would be blocked by censorship, or where bandwidth may be limited.\r\n\r\nChaining together such mirrors and using multiple fallbacks would allow one to set up a reliable content delivery method in remote areas.\r\n\r\n### NAS\r\n\r\nSomeone buys a home NAS like device.  They plug it into Ethernet and are greeted by A QR code on it's display, which they then scan, sending the device a friend request. They then accept it on the touchscreen.\r\n\r\nIn their Tox client, they navigate to the Profile Page for that account, which is just a list of links to tunneled HTTP services.\r\n\r\nThe browser opens a URL like SERVICENAME.TOXID.localhost:PORT, with the port being fixed.    The Tox client sniffs the HTTP headers and determines  who it must connect to, and establishes a tunnel, making the remote service appear at localhost.\r\n\r\nBy using subdomains and sniffing to differentiate ports, we are limited to HTTP services(And whatever else a sniffer exists for), anything else would have to be manually assigned a port.  However this also means that there is no risk of a port being reused for different services, and leaking cookies or local storage data between them.\r\n\r\n### Profile Pages/Filesharing\r\n\r\nA very small server can be embedded into a Tox client.  It does not have to worry about security at all as this is handled by the tunnel, so the code can be fairly trivial.\r\n\r\nAll it does is serve files, directly from a folder, perhaps with a bit of markdown rendering, and a data ratelimiter.\r\n\r\nThis folder can serve as the person's blog or personal website, resume, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile that kind of thing would ideally be fully P2P in most cases, that tech is not fully solidified, and there are some applications where one might prefer a traditional server model.\r\n\r\n### SSH Access and remote administration.\r\n\r\nA person launches a daemon on their server that creates a Tox account.  Using a command, they generate a QR, scan it, and accept the friend request back on the server side.\r\n\r\nThe account's page is a web based virtual terminal.\r\n\r\n### Presentations on a friend's screen\r\n\r\nOn their smart TV, they have a Tox app.  You have a presenter app.  After connecting, they go to your presenter app's page, which shows content streamed from your app.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Correspondence games with Web Workers\r\n\r\nBecause localhost is a secure context, we can use Service Workers to create pages that still work when the node hosting them is offline.  This is still not quite true \"no single points of failure\" behavior, but it should be good enough for a lot of things.\r\n\r\nSomeone could easily host something like a correspondence chess game from a special plugin in their client, that would sync when available.\r\n\r\nMore seriously, something like a disaster mapping applications could use this.  A person could collect data in an offline first app, then upload it to the host.\r\n\r\n### Web Torrents\r\n\r\nBy using CORS features, the tunneled pages could even serve as the basis for something like Web Torrents, allowing one to create a filesharing plugin that worked better than direct transfers.\r\n\r\n### Live Location Sharing\r\n\r\nFitness enthusiasts could use this to share telemetry data and history with their workout buddies, like the Garmin apps allow one to do today.\r\n",
