This mechanism makes sense when trying to bootstrap on initialization, or after a network outage. However, on very small networks, what you end up with is a lot of unsolicited network traffic to IP addresses that were once but are no longer part of the DHT. Furthermore, this spam persists even if the sender restarts the client, as the offline nodes are saved. \r\n\r\nThis is not only a big waste of bandwidth on the sender's part, but it's also annoying on the receiver's part, since their network logs get filled with inbound tox packets. But like I said, it only happens on small networks where there are fewer total nodes than there are peer slots. So my question is, is it worth worrying about? If so, how should it best be handled?",
