The concern is not around whether and how we can do it, but currently most (probably all) nospams in existing friend addresses in existence are written in little endian. Only those that were retrieved from a tox instance running on a big endian system would have big endian. To make it portable, we would need to enforce little endian. I would prefer to make it big endian, and when adding a friend, we could try adding both endiannesses in the transitional period while the old little endian friend addresses are phased out.\n",
