The audit says...\n\n> The  researchers  prove  that  the Signal Protocol achieves the former [deniability of content], but they claim that the latter [deniability of conversation] might only be theoretical. Because clients authenticate to the Open Whisper Systems server (similar to how an XMPP client authenticates to an XMPP server) and this server needs to know the addresses of the sender  and  recipient  in  order  to  guarantee  delivery,  the  logs  that  might  be  stored  by  the server can reveal that a conversation took place.\n> The  fact  that  a  conversation  took  place  might  leak,  but  through  another  layer  than  the application  layer  of  the  core  Signal  Protocol.   The  solution  to  such  leaking  of  metadata should  also  be  contained  in  the  appropriate  layer  and  should  stay  out  of  scope  for  the OMEMO specication.\n\nSo the audit it self suggests, that Deniability of conversation should remain out of scope.\n\n> So it would add to what we currently have: deniability of conversation and, if we don't have it yet, also future secrecy , and thirdly secure offline messages.\n\nNo, it wouldn't because from the the quotation from the OMEMO audit says that protection of the conversation, would have to go through a server. An adversary sitting on the wire between you and the person you're talking to would be able to prove you exchanged traffic. And with Tox, without deep packet inspection, it could just as easily be DHT traffic. \n\n> I don't think you will need a server for this.\n\nWhat part makes you think a server is optional?\n",

It's a crypto protocol, not a network protocol. It cannot hide ip addresses that are used. \nThat's not in the scope of a crypto library and should be addressed on the network layer, that's what the audit says. Tor can do that.\nBut it can take care of not proving via cryptographic means that a conversation took place.\ncf.\n\n> The solution to such leaking of metadata […]\n\n\"such\", meaning server logs.\nThe protocol, however, protects here against your communication partner, just as it does wrt content deniability, there also the server is not involved.\nSee in my previous comment the explanation of what it is meant to protect against:\n\n> Deniability of conversation means that if **your contact** wants to prove […]\n\nYour contact, not a server or ISP or wirehog.\n\n> No, it wouldn't because from the the quotation from the OMEMO audit says that protection of the conversation, would have to go through a server. \n\nI do not think so.\nWhy would you need a server to protect your conversation??\nThe audit does not say that it needs a server. It just mentions that if a server is used the server will be able to log connections and that this should be taken into account if such deniabiliy is claimed, and that this should then be done at the network layer.\nIf you use a server, the server knows your ip and your contact's ip, if you use p2p, your isp knows your name and your contact's ip plus your contact knows your ip. In either case if you want no one to know, use tor.  \n\n> An adversary sitting on the wire between you and the person you're talking to would be able to prove you exchanged traffic. And with Tox, without deep packet inspection, it could just as easily be DHT traffic.\n\nI don't think that this DHT traffic is a feature of libsodium, so it's orthogonal to the key exchange discussion. That means, you'd still have the same DHT traffic as before, and it would be equally hard for the adversary sitting on the wire to prove it.\n\n> What part makes you think a server is optional?\n\nBecause there are p2p solutions that use DH key exchanges which need no server (cf. toxcore) and direct p2p communication.\nThe point where axolotl relies on the server is for fetching pre-keys of offline contacts.\nBut that can be worked around by sharing pre-keys directly with the peer while he is still online.\nOnline key exchanges instead of pre-key server are supported.\nThis would then mean you cannot send an offline message to a contact that you have never chatted with, because he never sent you pre-keys for future communications, and there is no server to query for it. But I think this would be a very minor limitation. And this without storing pre-keys in the DHT.\nSo what makes you think it would need a server?\n\nFrom OMEMO website:\n\n> OMEMO not only gives you a better encryption features than OpenPGP and OTR but is also much easier to setup. OMEMO is the encryption you can actually use in your daily life. Turn it on once and forget you ever did.\n\nSounds pretty much like what tox wants to accomplish\n\n> Finally I can send encrypted messages to someone who is currently offline, uses mulitple clients and simultaneously receive a copy of that message on all of my devices.\n\nSorry for the long reply, but I hope it makes the axolotl threat model clearer and shows how it could fit into the big picture.\n",
