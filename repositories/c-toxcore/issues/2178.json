    "body": "I maintain [EchoBot](https://github.com/alexbakker/EchoBot), a small service for Tox that allows users to test their audio and video. It runs version 0.2.17 of c-toxcore. We've recently started seeing very large amounts of CPU and network usage. 100% CPU usage on the Tox thread and around 28 Mbit/s worth of network transmission, continuously. EchoBot has always been rough on resources when starting up, but would settle down eventually. The settling down part appears to no longer happen now that it has ~1400 friends.\r\n\r\nI used [Jfreegman's netprof branch](https://github.com/jfreegman/toxcore/tree/netprof) of toxcore to do some monitoring of the types of packets that are being sent. Here's a chart of the top packet types over the course of half a day:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2387841/160173285-6eeab092-3d64-422e-bf8e-29e905ef814a.png\">\r\n\r\nToxcore sends almost ~7500 ONION_SEND_INITIAL packets per second, continuously. @JFreegman provided some patches to try and nail down why toxcore seems to never back off of sending so many onion packets. He found that in this case toxcore regularly thinks that we're no longer connected to the Tox network and then resets the announcement run counter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/7dde71c4e9d4ff8e293b70f5c3ac08a504cc36f6/toxcore/onion_client.c#L1886-L1895\r\n\r\nI think there are possibly two things to do here:\r\n- Find out why toxcore thinks we're not connected the Tox network anymore (maybe it's right?)\r\n- Determine whether the observed network traffic is expected. Even with 1400 friends, ~7500 packets per second seems a bit excessive.",
