            "body": "I like the idea of JSON format since it is easy to read (for human) and is cross platform safe by it self. Indeed it requires one additional and external library but atleast in some cases clients can use the same library to handle they own part of config handling (optional part of config). Also, i'm having hard time thinking case where handling of cross platform configuration file, possibly containing rich content, is done without external libraries (JSON, msgpack, protobuf, whatever).\r\n\r\nI like the sudden6's idea that tox save format could contain two parts. \r\n**Basic part** - Contains essential and all absolutely needed parts of data to get account functional (only part which is really intepretted by toxcore).This basic part can be even versioned so that newer versions of toxcore could have attributes which are not undestood by older versions without problems.\r\n\r\n**Optional part** - Part which can contain client specific information or other information which is not required to get things working. This optional part would be something client can ask from toxcore. Clients could also ask toxcore to store something in this part of config. Any part of optional config should NOT be intepretted by toxcore but core gives it to the client as string. Clients can handle it as they want.\r\n\r\nWith JSON format, encrypting save file is trivial. Toxcore can encrypt save file by using any commonly used symmetric encryption algorithm with user given password. At the same time, encryption is not needed if user does not want to encrypt his save file and in this case toxcore can skip encryption/decryption phase. \r\n\r\nAbout security of two part idea. If config would contain two separate parts the basic part would be the only one which is really intepretted by toxcore. From this part toxcore reads all attributes to it's internal structures and this part is constructed back when toxcore saves the save file. For optional part of save file toxcore would introduce ONLY get and put functions for client. Those functions are used by clients to get and give they optional config parts. Toxcore should never reveal any JSON library related functions to client side or try to intepret optional parts. However, toxcore should validate JSON syntax of optional part in order to detect case where client is trying to include invalid config section. If i'm right, any invalid section in JSON makes whole JSON structure invalid. This must be detected by toxcore and invalid inclusion must not be alloved. Syntax validation of JSON should be pretty simple, safe and most probably already available by libraries.\r\n\r\nLet's think about pros and cons of JSON config file with basic and optional sections:\r\n**PROS**\r\n- human readable\r\n- dynamic, config can be versioned so that new attributes are skipped when they are not understood by different versions of toxcore.\r\n- simple (atleast basic part of config where attributes are well defined)\r\n- cross platform by it nature\r\n- commonly used format, many libraries and implementations available for many different languages.\r\n- To be text format, relatively size efficient\r\n- toxcore can always save simple version of save file if needed. That save file would contain only basic part of config without any optional parts. (prevents config bloating and would be version independent)\r\n\r\n**CONS**\r\n- Requires external library\r\n- Basic and optional splitting introduces security concerns\r\n- inefficient for binary data (friend avatars?)\r\n- If clients can freely include anything they want to the optional part of config save file may become huge pile of carbage (see pros. -> save simple version).\r\n- toxcore must syntax validate but not intepret optional parts\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all, I like the idea of JSON format for tox save file. However, implementation of it must be done carefully! More discussion please...",

I can not think now any binary data we would like to save in save file but in future we might have. Future is a bit hard to predict. :)\r\n\r\nBasic and optional parts has some security concerns if optional part is something clients can freely add in. That opens few ways how bugy client can set tox core in danger by giving well crafted or bugy data. I belive that this possibility could be minimized by making sure that parts added by client are not intepreted by toxcore and toxcore syntacticaly validates the parts clients want to include.\r\n\r\n@sudden6 \r\n> I exactly mean that clients can use whatever parsing method for they own config part which is saved into and loaded from file by toxcore. For example qTox does not need any external JSON parser because i think Qt has it's own JSON parser already. Also, if client is written with some other language they could have they own native JSON parsers and C parser library just makes things more complicated there.\r\n\r\n> I don't like the idea where clients implements they own export file. I'm worried that by that way we just get big number of uncompatible export files and huge mess. This should be toxcore's responsibility and feature.\r\n\r\nIf this kind basic and optional part separation is too risky at any matter, i still give +1 for JSON format.
