If one of the parties disables UDP, forcing toxcore to be TCP-only, it will use a TCP relay node as toxcore doesn't support direct connections via TCP. Also note that using a SOCKS/HTTP proxy forces the TCP-only mode. I'd like to say that seeing toxcore logs might help figure out why that happens, but I'm not too sure if they are as detailed as to mention the connection type per friend? Perhaps someone else could clarify that.",

So I assume your cone is not as full as your thought it was.\r\n\r\nDepending on your client you should have a file in json in the directory where your profiles are called something like DHTnodes.json - look in there for the most common Tox servers and ports that Tox will likely use. I don't know the routing algo but there may be capacity considerations that it make it's decisions on.\r\n\r\nI assume you are in Russia, and there are there are not many well known servers in Russia; I don't know the Tox routing algorithms , but Tox may have decided that on the opposite side of Globe was your nearest neighbor from its point of view. AFAIK there's nothing in Tox that allows the client to force a routing. \r\n\r\nIf you know anyone with well connected servers close to you it would be an idea to get them to run a BS node on their servers and add their IP:port info yourself to the DHTnodes.json file, and trim the nodes file down to ones you are OK with. That's the only control a client has that I know of, and it would only take 2 or 3 to influence things.\r\n\r\n@zoff99 @nurupo if 2 people ran BS servers that had only each other's nodes listed, and they had 2 clients with json files that only each other's node, would the 2 connect to each other only? Has anyone ever tried to run Tox over a p-to-p network link? \r\nA wiki page on routing would be great reading.",
