It creates a session keypair with NaCl and sends it to the other peer, the other peer then uses that public key and their session secret key to generate a shared key used for symmetric encryption. (You do the same thing with their session public key and your session secret key and get the same key). That key is then used to encrypt everything sent via the connection.\r\n> \r\n>> Please rekey after a given time! Let's say after 2 hours or 500 text messages or 10MB of transferred data, depending on which happens first.\r\n> \r\n> Yes, that's planned. How does rekeying every 2^16 packets sound? Personally I think that rekeying isn't that needed because if someone gets access to your machines ram while you are running Tox they can get all your messages from the message log of whatever client you are running. If someone has enough access to your system to obtain the session key then they don't even need it to know what you were doing with Tox.\r\n> \r\n> But since it's not hard to implement and doesn't have any drawbacks I have no issues with implementing it.\r\n\r\n@codedust [wrote](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/issues/1254#issuecomment-74140458):\r\n\r\n> The point is to make it even more difficult for an attacker (with a lot of computing power) who has **no** access to your machine to decrypt your whole communication during one session. Note that sessions can get quite long on mobile devices.\r\n> \r\n> Anyone interested in this may read these two blog post from OWS explaining how (and why) they designed the protocol behind Textsecure:\r\n> https://whispersystems.org/blog/asynchronous-security/\r\n> https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/",
