The stable network would be used by most users, while the test network can be broken sometimes and we can use it to experiment with new features (like new-group-chats). If it's a runtime option, it would be a boolean in `Tox_Options` and users could switch networks in their client. It would also be easier to run a bootstrap node supporting both networks in the same executable.",
