The IRC should be kept alive in case there are users, or potential users. It is expected that an opensource software package has an IRC channel to help users, and it was a good place for lurking former/retired/paused developers to keep an eye on things.\r\n\r\nInstead of abandoning the IRC and truncating the meagre documentation, I think we should keep IRC alive, and respond to users, or maybe even potential users. And some of us have Tox<->IRC bridges as software we are developing, so it's useful to have an active IRC group.\r\n\r\nJF said there were problems with the libera staff, and if that's the case, we should look at moving the group, not abandonning it. You need opensource projects to be visibly supported on IRC; the channel helped me a lot when I was getting started, and had a much broader audience than the dev NGC.\r\n\r\nThere's a good alternative at https://www.oftc.net/ I think. Good security and helpful staff; they have good support for IRC with security over Tor which not all IRCs do (and it's not easy).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know who setup the IRC on libera? Could they look at moving the group to oftc.net and leaving a banner message on libera to say it's moved?\r\n\r\n",

Moreover, moving to another server doesn't address the underlying problems:\r\n\r\n- The possibility of spying on users' communications shouldn't be a feature of the architecture. This obviously goes for private conversations, but also for group chats, as users should not have to worry about people outside of the group reading their conversations without the consent of anyone in the channel. Just as we shouldn't have to worry about our living room being bugged, so too should we not have to worry about this with our online groups. \r\n- Relying on strangers for our communication infrastructure and putting blind faith in their good will is undesirable, as we've learned the hard way twice now\r\n- Using a service that doesn't use encryption by default and has no other option than an inherently flawed encryption scheme is highly problematic (client-server, authority based). This alone is enough reason to stay off IRC. \r\n\r\nThis community has created a solution to all of these problems. We're presently using that solution for the majority of our development discussions, and everyone is free to join us. The only thing the community lacks is intuitive and fully functional clients (I hesitantly admit that Toxic is not so user-friendly). That however is not a toxcore issue.\r\n\r\nTo address the issue of potential new users and people who might be looking for us in IRC, what we should be doing is maintaining our channels in libera and directing them towards the Tox development group. If there aren't already instructions in the topic, there should be. If newcomers aren't able or willing to use the software that they ostensibly want to contribute to despite being given all the tools to do so, they probably wouldn't be able to contribute in a meaningful way in the first place.\r\n\r\n<strike>This is the last I'm going to say on this topic</strike>, unless someone can give a legitimate technical reason why they (or newcomers) are unable to join the Tox groupchat, in which case we should focus on resolving it rather than sweeping it under the rug. I recall @nurupo once mentioned that he wasn't able to use a bouncer in Tox, however that issue could be resolved by running a Toxic instance on a remote server that the bouncer would typically be run on (which is something I do myself). Also, someone could easily write a proper bouncer.",
