    "body": "Turns out there's a lot to testing Tox with Tor. I say with Tor explicity because it's kind of a worse case scenario for a SOCKS5 proxy and it implies some extra gotchas:\r\n\r\n1. you want to test on a linux  ipv6.disable=1 booted systems and run ctest cleanly\r\n2. you want to test udp disabled, and make sure nothing uses UDP, and that includes DNS leaks on 53.\r\n3. you want to make sure nothing UDP is ever required to boostrap\r\n4. you have to redefine your notion of timeoooooooooooooooooooooouts\r\n5. should your testing reuse a tox profile to cache the peers?\r\n\r\nFor testing this means adding a Dockerfile test of a qemu machine booted   ipv6.disable=1 but also with all of the setup to make apt get in the VM to use Tor. And if you want to use ctest: Tox configures with SOCKS port and host and udp and ipv6 disabled.\r\n\r\nAnd I think this means adding the ip:port for DNS to ToxOptions: in normal tor usage, UDP is firewalled, IPV6 is firewalled and DNS is on port 9053, so Tox must either DNS resolve through tor (like HTTP connect), or add a DNS to ToxOptions.\r\n\r\nI'll start by just listing related open issues:\r\n1, An oldie but goldie: https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/469 which raises the issue of DNS leaks - look carefully at @nurupo comment https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/469#issuecomment-279122102\r\n2. The first ever testing of ctest with ipv6=false https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/2335 using USE_IPV6\r\n3. the ability to test with ipv6=false https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/2468 \r\n6. An equivalent to https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/pull/2468 is needed for UDP defining USE_UDP_TEST\r\n7. https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/2469 for SOCKS_HOST_TEST and SOCKS_PORT_TEST \r\n8. A more flexible approach to timeouts: ctest --timeout 1800 does nothing: the test timeout is 120 sec, in CMake\r\n\r\nThere are some related issues:\r\n1. I raised https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/1432 in NGC a lot because I thought it shouldn't even be sending ipv6 packets when it was disabled - but got told SNAFU. I don't think I knew that there was an old issue open on it.  It used to drive me nuts - went into the code and turned it off, but not recently - or did I turn off toxcore logging in toxygen - maybe that was my answer!? I always compile DEBUG...\r\n2. https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/1026 which I think is stll active.\r\n",

If I'm right is there an obvious way to clean this up?\r\n\r\nI note that Tox's proxy test calls tox_bootstrap once even on a tox4 which is udp disabled: https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/master/auto_tests/proxy_test.c#L114",
