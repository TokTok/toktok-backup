(I made an accout there and applied for write permissions by never heard back as I wamted to add some of the pages from [my wiki](https://git.plastiras.org/emdee/tox_profile/wiki).) There's a lot of outdated information there that needs cleaning up: the people interested in the project must realize that it is the public face of Tox.\r\n\r\nThe reason I suggest this is because I'm seeing a lot of \"rewrite-from-scratch\" which can be a planning failure if it's not been thought out (think Netscape) and for that you need discussion in something like a wiki. You can't use NGC for that sort of thing, as you have no history of when you're not connected, and it's susceptible to impersonation https://github.com/JFreegman/toxic/issues/622\r\n",
