            "body": "What if a peer exits or gets kicked out while you are offline? Since you didn't observe that event, the peer would still remain in your peer list when they really shouldn't. Sounds rather complex, as this would require peer list synchronization among group chat peers and conflict resolution in order to function properly, and even then some events might get missed by multiple peers you are synchronizing your peer list with and you might still end up with peers being listed in your peer list despite them have exited or being kicked out, having to perform some sort of a peer list cleanup periodically.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps it's fine if the peer list is not synchronized with other group chat peers to account for the events that you didn't observe, i.e. if it's just your personal observation peer list? For example, in addition to the currently online peer list, a client would display a list of offline peers that the client has previously observed being online, something like \"Peers seen in the last N days\" or \"Last N offline peers\". While toxcore could keep track of offline peers like that, this is something that could be done client-side.\r\n\r\nI want to point out that this stable peer list feature also opens up an avenue for a DoS attack that should somehow be addressed. A malicious user could keep rejoining the same group with new group identity, increasing the peer list of everyone in the group chat. This might be less of an issue for an actively moderated group chat, but if the moderators are often afk, someone creating thousands of new peers per second might pose an issue. Even if the moderators in the same timezone and are asleep for 8 hours, that might still pose an issue. The peer list is stored in the RAM as toxcore doesn't do disk storage, so all the attacker would need to do is to create enough peers to make toxcore + the client consume all the available RAM. One way around that would be setting a limit on the number of offline peers toxcore remembers per a group chat to some reasonable amount, allowing the client to change that limit via API.",
