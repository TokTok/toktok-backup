            "body": "I understand how this point can feel incorrect, so I've filed a documentation issue to improve our presentation of that. Thanks for explaining your thoughts.\r\n\r\nTo quickly explain your specific concern, I'll paraphrase it. Please let me know if I misunderstood:\r\n\r\n**Q:** _I am concerned about the fact that data packets coming from my computer are not delivered directly to my friend's computer, but are sometimes (or all the time, depending on network conditions) relayed via third party computers._\r\n\r\n**A:** First, consider a packet going directly from your computer to your friend's computer, assuming you're on a local wifi:\r\n- Your computer creates an encrypted Tox packet (see [encryption details](https://toktok.github.io/spec#box)), which it wraps in a UDP packet containing the source/destination ports (random/33445), then in an IP packet containing the source/destination IP addresses (you and your friend), then a Wireless frame containing the source/destination MAC addresses (you and access point(s)).\r\n- This Wireless frame is sent over an AES encrypted channel (assuming WPA2).\r\n- The wireless access point as well as every other user of the network receives it. Other users usually ignore the packet, but don't have to. Reading packets that are not meant for you is called sniffing. **This is the first point at which others can read the packet.**\r\n- The wireless access point is connected to a WAN (internet) router that establishes a connection to the routers of your internet service provider via some means (acoustic coupling, ISDN, ADSL, Cable, Satellite, fibre, ...). This connection can be encrypted (some satellites) but usually isn't. At this point, the WAN router you've sent your packet to will create an Ethernet frame containing its own MAC address and the MAC address of the next router it connects to, which is your ISP router. In transit, the IP and MAC addresses are likely unencrypted and can be read by anyone sniffing the fibre optics between you and the ISP. **This is the second point at which others can read the packet.**\r\n- Once the packet arrived at the ISP, it will go through various internal systems in their data centres, possibly encrypted or unencrypted at various points in time. The ISP router will then decide the next router it should send the packet to, determined by the IP address. To do this, it will unwrap the Ethernet frame it received and wrap it in a new one and send it off to the next router. At any point during processing at the ISP, data centre or system administration employees of that ISP can access your packet. **Third point of access.**\r\n- Now your packet will be hopping from router to router (try `traceroute $your_friend_ip` to see where it goes), each of which has free access to the Ethernet frame, the IP packet, and the UDP packet as well as its contents. **Many points of access, let's call it the 4th.**\r\n- Then your friend may be in a similar situation, in a local wifi in a different place. Again their router and members of the wireless network can read the packet. **Fifth point of access.**\r\n- Only now, finally, your packet arrives at your friend's computer. It receives a Wireless frame, unwraps it to find an IP packet, unwraps it to find a UDP packet, unwraps it to find a Tox packet, which is then processed by the Tox protocol implementation. This processing involves decrypting and decoding the packet and acting on it, usually resulting in your friend's client displaying the message, playing audio or video, or perform some other application level activity.\r\n\r\nAs you see, there are many points during the \"direct\" transmission from you to your friend where the packet can be inspected by arbitrary people. End-to-end encryption means that at no point between you and your friend can anyone read the actual contents you intended to convey. They can always only see the encrypted data.\r\n\r\nNow, adding a TCP relay in the middle will simply lengthen the route (it could theoretically shorten it, but that's not likely). Anyone running the relay can read the packet, just like anyone else between you and your friend. The Tox crypto protocol ensures that your communication is secure.\r\n\r\nNow, I also see a second concern:\r\n\r\n**Q:** _What happens if one of the nodes relaying my data is evil?_\r\n**A:** Tox selects a number of TCP relays that it can use to communicate in case direct UDP connections are not possible (e.g. due to NAT or firewall). Evil relays can do very few things to do evil:\r\n- They can choose not to send the packet. In this case, Tox will retry via a different relay. Only if all bootstrap nodes are evil will a transmission fail.\r\n- They can send a modified packet. Thanks to message authentication codes, any tampering with the data is likely to be detected. If the sender manages to tamper in a way that is undetected by software, the decrypted packet will be garbage, and the application layer (the Tox protocol decoder) will discard it. This therefore has the same effect as not relaying the packet at all.\r\n\r\nThat's basically it. In no case can the evil relay read your data. It can only choose not to relay, and only if every bootstrap node is evil, you can't communicate. This would be pretty annoying, and we would be unhappy about it, but nobody's information is compromised at any point.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI hope this clarifies some things. I have not proofread this reply, but I'll make sure it's properly represented on the website for future reference. Let me know if you have any other concerns. Thanks again for bringing this up.",

This means that if one of those keys is compromised, a few messages can be decrypted, but not your entire communication history. The \"a few messages\" part of this sentence will be reduced to \"one message\" in the future. If your long term secret key is compromised, no past communication can be decrypted.\r\n\r\nIf the cryptographic primitives we use are broken, we lose. It depends in which way they are broken, these are possible worst-case scenarios:\r\n- The cipher ([salsa20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20)) can be easily reversed without a key. In this case, all past communication is compromised.\r\n- The key exchange primitive ([curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519)) is broken in a way that the secret key can easily be recovered given a public key. In this case, also all past communication is compromised.\r\n\r\nThese scenarios are very unlikely to become reality in the near future, or possibly forever. By current understanding in the cryptography community, only quantum computing could make the second scenario happen. The first scenario is believed to be impossible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis all said, I also noticed that you said you have a direct IPv4 address. What does this mean? If you have a public IPv4 address assigned to your computer, and port 33445 is open, Tox should establish direct connections very quickly. If it doesn't, that's a bug and we should work together to find out why it chooses to use TCP instead.",

This requires client support I don't think any client currently has:\r\n- Get the DHT public key from the client with public IP and open port (`tox_self_get_dht_id`) and its port (`tox_self_get_udp_port`).\r\n- Send this key to the other one somehow (dictate via phone or message on Skype or something).\r\n- The other one now needs to bootstrap using the `(key, ip, port)` tuple.\r\n\r\nAfter this, you have a personal 2-people Tox network. So, in theory you don't need any other nodes. They do make things easier, though.\r\n\r\nIf one of you has a public IP and open port, then connecting to bootstrap nodes should also let you establish a direct connection. DHT bootstrap nodes have little to do with whether you can connect or not. A direct connection should be possible even if only one of you has an public IP and open port. The other one would connect to it, which would create a route in the local router and give the client a temporary random public port.",
