And the world was good.\r\n\r\nBut it all changed when the fire nation attacked. Well actually I have no idea why it all changed, but for the past year or so, filetransfers have been useless. Even on fast connections, you often get a case where (I assume due to tcp->udp switch), the transfer dies. Or it just dies randomly. Or the speed is a fraction of what it should be. Or the speed is like an ocean wave; instead of being high, it goes to super high, chokes the line, back to like 1KiB/s and then again back to super high.\r\n\r\nA fix for file transfers would be amazing.",
