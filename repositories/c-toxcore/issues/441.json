Checked it with a sniffer and looks like encrypted data. Did some Google search and I suppose it's DHT traffic coming from the bootstrap node I connect to. Can DHT traffic relaying be disabled?\r\n\r\nI'm behind a firewall (restricted work network) and no other clients or nodes can connect to me. I also cannot connect to any other nodes that do not default to port 443. So I think it's nonsense for me to relay traffic. Or relay among whom? The only node I can communicate with is a TCP relay bootstrap node.",

I would be really sad about this. I don't think it's a good idea not to care about the resource consumption toxcore causes in all clients based on it. We'll end up with something like the so-called \"modern web\". Like the Facebook website which is the most bloated interface ever.\r\n\r\nHowever it could be different.\r\n\r\nThey're just some main concepts that should be changed. This is an architerctural decision. There are users that can relay a lot of traffic, e.g. desktop computers with a 10Mbit/100Mbit internet connection. Call them supernodes. All desktop clients should have an option to relay the traffic or not and it should be enabled by default. It should have three states **Enabled / Disabled / Auto**. Auto should be the default. When it's active, Toxcore should do measurements and compute some statistics for itself of network delay, ping and throughput, and CPU usage (!). If the network performance is constantly low or CPU usage caused by Toxcore is high, it should give up the onion style routing for some hours or days. On mobile devices these should be disabled completely.\r\n\r\nFriend announcement should be asynchronous. So if I connect via a client that has relaying disabled, it announces me to one of the bootstrap nodes. The bootstrap nodes introduce me to the DHT network so the supernodes can announce me to other relay-disabled clients.\r\n\r\nWhen I open a chat window with someone toxcore should establish **a P2P connection** to the friend. UPnP must have a high priority for implementation. It's supported by millions of devices and P2P connections could spare most of the traffic for the relay nodes.\r\n\r\nAvatars and any meta information (like status messages) should not be sent unless there is any communication. Or there should be a logic like the **avatar and the status message should be timestamped** and be sent just once a friend comes online. So it should be a local hash table with timestamps paired with friend IDs. Timestamps represent the time a friend successfully received my avatar and stauts message. If the timestamp of the avatar doesn't represent a time later than my avatar was changed, **nothing should be sent to that friend**.\r\n\r\nTox needs serious optimizations like above or it will be the same bloated messenger like all other cloud applications (like Facebook's Messenger) or java-based torrent clients. I don't want to see this happen.",

Furthermore, it will deserve not to be popular if this is because of the narrow-sighted idealism of developers.\r\n\r\nWe are talking about two problems here.\r\n\r\n1. Tox relays all traffic into an onion in order to hide the identity of its users. In 99% of the cases this should not be necessary. This will only be necessary if you live in a police state where secret service comes after you just because of the fact that you communicate with someone on the Tox network or lock you up without a warrant for the same reason. In western world, like the USA or the EU this is not the situation. **Pure P2P connections should be allowed and even made default.** It will take a huge amount of load off the onion and leave it for people who really need it. For these reasons, Tox would have to be redesigned, using the distributed network only for finding each other, and using the onion only when specified.\r\n\r\n2. Tox makes it compulsory to participate in traffic relaying, regardless of the bandwidth and other technical limits of the network connection used. In the long term this will make the network very unreliable as well as making mobile users with data plans waste a lot of money for relaying the traffic. **Traffic relaying should be made optional.**\r\n",
