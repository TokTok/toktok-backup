    "body": " Guys, let's decide how we will continue to develop. I understand that there is a development roadmap. It is relevant, but there is no internal organization and coordination. Those questions that are marked high priority is not being release is often tolerated. Need understanding and persistent movement toward the goal. To write a new Protocol is not easy, but we've been doing this for 4 years... Too many. There are many fundamental problems of the Protocol, such as simultaneous work on multiple devices simultaneously, offline messages and more. But it is solved. There is a platform ready that can be used as solutions for a particular issue.\r\n In my opinion, the project needs a coordinator, the Manager, who will lead a team and help. Also need experts in cryptography and security, key programmers, the person responsible for the packaging and infrastructure. For more incentive, we can arrange groundpounding of the company.\r\nReady to nominate his candidacy for the post of project coordinator. Yes, I am an ordinary user and do not understand programming, but I'm a responsible attitude to work.\r\n Let's forget the infighting.\r\nWhat do you say? @iphydf @irungentoo @JFreegman @grayhatter @nurupo @mannol ",

In order\nto sensibly discuss non-trivial changes, we need a clear and complete\naccount of the protocol which c-toxcore implements. The spec we have is\na good start, but it isn't complete and it could be much clearer. I've\nbeen working on the DHT part of this on hs-toxcore as part of the\nprocess of developing a haskell implementation; having a relatively\nreadable and easily adjustable implementation in haskell/rust will\nhopefully also be very helpful, but work on the spec can be done\nseparately from and before work on reimplementation.\n\nOnce the relevant documentation is in place, I think we should think\ncarefully about bandwidth-optimisation. My impression is that network\nusage could be reduced a lot even without any breaking change to the\nprotocol. Hopefully this will also help with the problems on mobile\nphones.\n\nI don't like the idea of wasting energy and risking splits by trying to\nuse an alternative to irc.\n",

It might also solve the problem on mobile, since instead of running the whole application the whole time you can get around this with a wrapper that automatically starts and closes tox every x minutes to check for messages, pipes them to notificaion thingy and then when the user interacts with it tox is opened again and after he doesn't send or receive a message for x minutes, tox closes automatically.",

Any time I bring up Tox to technical people, they bring up security issues. If it's not just as easy for more easy to use than Facetime and Skype than normal people have no reason to use it. If it's not more secure than WebRTC/Wire/Jitsi/other centralized things then technical people have no reason to use it. \r\n\r\nAs for the public face, \"clients\" do not make any sense to normal people. Normal people don't know what the web is, or what an application is, or difference is. Normal people don't know what a server is, or what that means for it to be down. They don't know what a client is, or mean it means for a client to not be able to connect to anything. Having multiple clients is awesome and I hope people keep making them. Though to present themselves to the public Tox should have a singular \"official\" face. Downloading \"antidote\" on their iPhone and \"qTox\" on their Macbook makes no sense to normal people. They'll think it's two entirely different apps made be competing corporations. I know this because I have tried it. I love uTox, I like RaTox and Toxic a lot. But I think qTox should just be \"Tox for computers\" and Antidote and AnTox need to be renamed \"Tox for smartphones.\" Nerds like me will always be able to look at the wiki/Github and find obscure of specialized clients for our own nerdy needs. Normal people need to be spoonfed. I know this because of the job I work. This is all boring marketing stuff, but this is how one gets powerful crypto into the hands of everyday people. \r\n\r\nI think organizing better is good, and setting up a Mattermost is good too. But Tox devs have a bad history with communicating with people interesting in using it or watching it grow. Switching to a private room type of thing would cut those people out entirely, I think. But I have not used Mattermost before. Don't use Dischord/Slack or proprietary things like that. Not that the type of people to develop an encrypted, decentralized Skype replacement would use things like that.\r\n\r\nI want Tox to win. I don't know C/C++ so I can't really help. When there is a more finished product worth showing to the public, I want to help with advertising, if I can. I don't know what else I can do, I just know I want Tox to succeed. \r\n",
