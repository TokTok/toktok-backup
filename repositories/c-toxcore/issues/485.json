Users should be able to send messages of any size.\r\n\r\nTox should be able to recombine pieces and present the message the way it was sent.\r\n\r\n* SUGGESTION\r\n\r\n```tox_friend_send_message``` should accept messages with 64-bit client-generated messageId, 32-bit partNo and 32-bit partCount so that clients will be able to keep track of the individual split messages, and display them as a single message when all parts arrived.\r\n",
