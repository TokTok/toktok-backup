Some proposed solutions to it require having a centralized trusted party that verifies identities of every single node on DHT, which compromizes anonymity of the DHT and makes the centralized trusted party a target for an attack. BitTorrent's DHT is vulnerable to it. Bitcoin seems to restrict the number of peers it makes an out band connection with by IP range, e.g. only one node in /16 subnet, but I'm not sure if this would work for a DHT as you would have Id-space gaps in the routing table, and how would that work with IPv6.",

The primary function of the tox DHT isn't actually to store and \nretrieve data, but to find a DHT peer's external IP+port so we can \ndirectly connect to it if possible, and otherwise to find peers we can \nconnect to who have a connection to the peer, and so can co-ordinate \nattempts to punch through firewalls by port-guessing. In other words, \nthe DHT acts as a kind of distributed STUN-server (but doing more than \nin STUN).\n\nTo help with this, the eviction strategy isn't Kademlia's; instead we \nfavour the nodes within a given bucket which are XOR-closest to us. This \nleads to pairs of peers each trying to add the other to a bucket, which \nis enough to get through certain pairs of NAT types. This should mean \nthat the tox DHT tends to be rather less \"restricted\" than in the \nsetting of that paper -- though I haven't seen any actual measurements \nchecking this.\n\nWe do also have plans to use the DHT to store information in the \ntraditional way. There's a proposal for this at\nhttps://github.com/zugz/tox-DHTAnnouncements/blob/master/DHTAnnouncements.md#user-content-announcing-and-searching \nwhich uses a mix of the \"iterative\" and \"recursive\" techniques -- \nkeeping control of the search with the searcher, but handling \ninaccessible nodes by setting up routes to forward search requests. \nComments on this would be very welcome. Based on a quick examination of \nR5N, the key advantages of this scheme over R5N are that there's no need \nto estimate the network size, the packets are smaller (no need for \na bloom filter), and less state and traffic is required for reterning \nresponses to requests since we shortcut the routes with direct \nconnections where possible. But for a network which is really highly \nrestricted (with a large majority of nodes behind symmetric NAT, and few \nbehind full cone or no NAT), a recursive procedure like R5N would work \nbetter.\n",
