The `tar.gz` and `zip` tarballs in Releases are automatically generated by GitHub, we don't modify them, we just sign them. But apparently it's a good practice to release tarballs with `autogen.sh` already being ran and removed from the source tree. So, before releasing, we'd need to download those `tar.gz` and `zip` (or better yet just use your local git copy), run `autogen.sh` in them, compress them back and replace GitHub's tarballs with ours. Don't forget the signing. Can't you wait to ditch autotools in favor of cmake? : P Though cmake has it's own cons and pros: it's developer-friendly, but not very user-friendly (while I find autotools being the opposite).",
