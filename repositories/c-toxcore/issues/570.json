There was [some work](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/pull/424) done on [improving FreeBSD support](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/pull/473) not that long ago (we are even [setting up FreeBSD CI](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/pull/505)), but OpenBSD is a quite different beast and FreeBSD fixes don't necessarily apply it.",

Running TCP_test through ktrace, there are many calls to setsockopt that fail with errno 22 - invalid argument. TCP_test includes TCP_server.h, which includes onion.h, which includes DHT.h with includes network.h and in network.c, getsockopt and setsockopt are used.\r\nQuoting from an openbsd man page: \r\n     For security reasons, OpenBSD does not route IPv4 traffic to an AF_INET6\r\n     socket, and does not support IPv4 mapped addresses, where IPv4 traffic is\r\n     seen as if it comes from an IPv6 address like ::ffff:10.1.1.1.  Where\r\n     both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic need to be accepted, listen on two sockets.\r\n\r\nI rebuilt c-toxcore with more logging, test-suite attached. \r\n I think TCP_test fails silently as it does not call \r\nc-toxcore/toxcore/network.c:581\r\nnew_networking_ex\r\nwhich contains the LOG_DEBUG functions.\r\n\r\nIt seems the errors are handled in other parts of the code, and clients can specify if they want to use IPv4 or IPv6 only. From my basic testing with a tox client, I think toxcore works even though the tests fail. ",
