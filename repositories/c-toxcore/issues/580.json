If so, I wonder if the problem \ncould be that your connection to the TCP relays is being blocked for \nsome reason. It looks like this could easily go undetected by TCP_Client \nfor 15 seconds, so then the onion would timeout before new relays would \nbe connected to.\n\nIf this is the problem, switching to the latest version of toxcore might \nactually \"fix\" it, because a side-effect of some recent changes was to \nincrease the timeout for disconnection from the onion.\n\nThis wouldn't explain the difference in period between uTox and qTox, \nthough...\n",

I've logged the case assuming that \n\nNo, ip3 is the third onion node in the path. Assuming you're doing this \nin send_onion_packet_tcp_udp, the destination IP_port is 'dest'.\n\nBut it doesn't make any sense for there to be a problem with the \ndestinations - your corporate firewall can't do anything on that end.\n\nI'm not sure what to advise for further debugging.

At work, neither TCP nor UDP work on 33445 or other high ports, nor sub-1024 - but TCP does work on my SSH , HTTP, HTTPS ports.\r\n\r\nSo it does look like my work firewall is probably messing things up, and for this test it affects both TCP and UDP, but only on some ports. I don't understand how I then have a working Tox connection to the DHT at all, when the family is usually IPv4 UDP on sent announces, and ports are either 33445 or a little higher, which also fail when I test with netcat..",
