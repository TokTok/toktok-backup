It's true that poisoning the DHT is a way to attack the onion, and \nthat what I'm proposing for the DHT doesn't actually make it immune to \npoisoning, just more expensive to poison.\n\nYou can still bombard a node with Nodes Requests from nodes you create \nusing random DHT pubkeys, until eventually you hit upon the right keys \nand they add your nodes. A more subtle but less effective attack is to \nbias the closelists of peers by responding to Node Requests with \ninformation about only your own nodes. \n(These are the manifestations in Tox of the 'push' and 'pull' poisonings \ndiscussed in the Brahms paper.)\n\n>In one of the issues I've already mentioned Brahms: Byzantine Resilient \n>Random Membership Sampling: \n>https://gnunet.org/sites/default/files/Brahms-Comnet-Mar09.pdf \n\nThanks for pointing to this again. It does have some interesting ideas \nwhich may well be applicable. It looks like we could even implement much \nof it without breaking backwards compatibility (though not the \"limited \nsend\" component).\n\nI think for now we should leave making the DHT fully unpoisonable to \nfuture work. In this issue I want to concentrate on the onion modulo the \nDHT, i.e. making the onion do its job when we assume that the DHT is \ndoing its job. As long as poisoning the DHT is expensive, this is \nworthwhile in itself.\n",

            "body": "Sybil attacks are the fundamental problem. If a Sybil attacker can poison our\r\nlocal view of the network, onion paths we build from it will be compromised.\r\nIn particular, the \"Brahms\" system linked to above specifically assumes away\r\nSybil attackers. Namely, it assumes that attackers have access to only so many\r\nfixed network identities (DHT keys in the tox case) - if the attacker can\r\ngenerate new ones at will, the guarantees in the paper don't apply.\r\n\r\nSection 3 of\r\nhttp://www.distributed-systems.net/my-data/papers/2011.acm-cs.pdf\r\ngives a nice overview of defences against Sybil attacks on DHTs. If we assume\r\nwe want to be able to resist attackers using a botnet, then there are only two\r\ntypes of known solution. One is to have a central authority certifying users,\r\nwhich I assume we agree is inappropriate. The other is to exploit features of\r\nhuman social networks. This may well be appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe most relevant systems of this kind are SybilGuard\r\nhttp://www.math.cmu.edu/~adf/research/SybilGuard.pdf ,\r\nand its successor SybilLimit\r\nhttps://cs.nyu.edu/srg/docs/sybillimit-tr.pdf .\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is that a Sybil attacker will have only so many friend\r\nrelations with honest nodes (\"attack edges\" in the friend graph); using this,\r\nand assuming that the honest part of the graph is connected and fast mixing,\r\nit's possible for an honest node to verify whether a given node is honest\r\nwith a low false positive rate.\r\n\r\nSo my current thinking is that we should adapt SybilLimit, using the Tox\r\nfriend graph, then use it to verify DHT nodes. This isn't straightforward -\r\nSybilLimit assumes a static network of always-on peers, with no privacy\r\nrequirements - but it looks like it should be doable. The costs in network\r\ntraffic would be considerable, but hopefully bearable.\r\n\r\nThis would give users resistance to Sybil attacks once they're part of a\r\nsufficiently large connected component of the friend network. Then a\r\nBrahms-like system can be used to get an unpoisoned view of the component,\r\nfrom which onion paths can be built.\r\n\r\nPlenty of details need to be sorted. But I wonder what people think of this\r\noverall vision? It's complicated and might involve a compatibility break, but\r\nas far as I can see it's the only possibility for a true solution. And I'm not\r\nconvinced that anything less than a true solution is worth having at all.\r\n",

Sorry for not saying earlier.\n\nThere are lots of problems, but the fundamental one is this: any such \nscheme requires us to have a long-term identifier which we share with \narbitrary DHT nodes, which they will try to use to determine whether or \nnot we're sybil. But this in itself is a big problem: since friend \nrelationships between nodes identified by IP address / DHT public key \nare not kept private in tox, a crawler can easily map out the friend \nnetwork indexed by these long-term identifiers. That's a big privacy \nproblem.\n\nSo I'm coming reluctantly to the conclusion that we should give up on \nmaking the DHT sybil-resistant. That does also mean giving up on the \nonion.\n\nGrayhatter suggested using per-edge rendezvous spots, and I'm belatedly \ncoming round to the idea that this might be the best (only?) solution. \nBut that's a topic for another issue.\n",
