Tox started when Snowdens revelations were a big thing, everything related to NSA and global surveillance was picked up by news sites and channels, Tox was on that wave. After that nothing really happened, people kept using their smartphones, they kept selling out their private data just out of convenience. So that hype was gone at some point.\r\n\r\nProject wise - Tox and Tox clients are still not included in major Linux distros, Tox is not part of standard distro repositories, I think this is a very important aspect that would help to gain more popularity. Are there any releases? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there are none... it's still marked as \"in development\". People usually don't like things that are \"in development\", people expect a stable release.\r\n\r\nI still use Tox and given how terrible Skype has become (honestly, back then I could not imagine it could get worse, but it actually did!) I would really like to see a stable Tox release going into all major distros. I had a Tox call with my buddy today - the audio quality was way better than with the newest Skype client. Tox could present itself as option. It works!\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that the main reason for not having a release marked as \"stable\" is the promise of being totally secure which is not yet fully met (or is it?), but maybe it's time to take a step aside from the goal to guarantee full security from the very beginning and for starters just become a good messenger for audio and video calls, which imho Tox is already fully capable of.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents.",

It is true that we don't hear that much about illegal spying as we did back then, but on the other hand we now have many more apps for secure messaging: Signal, Riot, Jitsi. I don't know for sure what qualifies as stable, but I would say that uTox and qTox are stable clients (I haven't used any others yet). Tox still misses a few important features like offline messaging, but I think it's ready to be included in distros. For Tox to be secure it would need a security audit, right? Then we need more people using it to be able to do that. Making Tox more available would definitely help with that goal! Other thing that attracts users are new features and we don't get too many of them. Also many people won't switch to Tox until their friends start using it.",

I don't see one... when I was more involved in the project it was still very much in a \"being developed\" state, even though it was already functioning for the users point of view.\r\n\r\nOf course it's up to the developers to decide when a project is \"ready\" for the 1.0.0 release, I'm only saying - not having a \"release\" and not being in the distros does not help. Your friend will most likely not install any client that he or she will have to compile first and personally I am not a fan of third-party binary packages either. Being in a distro b default is a huge boost for a project and I'm talking from first hand experience here...\r\n\r\n",

Laugh as you might but it is the computer you have in your pocket 99% of the time you need to communicate with someone. That is the case with most people...and hence if tox isn\"t a solid messanger on that platform people will go elsewhere.....signal? Personally, I would love to see Tox go to the area of email. This is where security is seriously lacking and spam is rife.. Imagine for a start Markdown suppport on all clients. Imagine a separation of contacts and conversations in the sense that if I delete a conversation I should not have to scan your pub key to start another one with you. Then conversations should be grouped in any way you like say on a topic or subject line....so we could have a conversation on Tox and a separate (visually) conversation about the weather and a separate one about plans for tomorrow....with full support for attachments.....why? Because  it is far more constructive to focus conversations down to single subject so that it can stay on topics and then once a topic/project is done with delete or archive it to recover storage space etc. Imagine how many people would jump on it when they find out it has (tox) zero spam.. And it will always have so... unlimited attachments think videographers working on a film... high need for privacy and huge data transfer needs but usually mail servers have various pathetic attachment data limits, the need for mail servers and their other policies and logging... Imagine human rights reporters in hostile environs needing to send footage quickly and securely and SAFELY off. Imagine documenting police brutality...SNOWDEN etc Various other scenarios where email and pgp leave much to be desired. But mostly because we need to upgrade away from the monitored world of email for all our other projects be they schoolwork or business discussions that we dont want the isp's mail administrator reading etc. Let's make this TOX baby fly instead of just texting...which is also important.  What do you mean it has no outbound que, it should have been there from day one....how else does one compose a reply offline? It would go a long way to solving queuing issues? And ofcourse the more you and your contact use Tox then the likeliness of you being online at the same time increase dramatically. Perhaps this could be enhanced with push notifications but that should be optional at the client. There is just soooo much potential but lets just get the mobile clients to a solid start first. Then add Markdown across the board followed by outbound queuing and conversations grouping and full attachment support. This would see huge rise in usage. Actually if you look at the DHT usage graphs it is growing but yeah I think Signal has definetly taken a big chunk of users away from Tox and we  need a solid focus to regain ground....email is that ground. What do you all think?",

I'm not sure what you mean by full support for attachments, because you can already send files. But there is no offline messaging yet, which is one of the missing features. If Tox had that and multi device support it would probably be better than email. I don't think that would be enough to get rid of email though. Even if Tox gets very popular not everyone will be using it. Plus you still need an email account to register on any website, because that's how web works. You can group conversations by creating groupchats, but I personally don't see how it could be useful. Most people probably don't chat like that. Also that is most likely a client issue. Same with markdown. If you want those features you need to talk about them with client developers.",
