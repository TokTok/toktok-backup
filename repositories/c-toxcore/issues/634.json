I think Tox needs to do the same. Maybe try to get help from Mozilla and other organizations that give money to free software projects?

It doesn't strictly have to involve persistence across restart. Again, beyond the ability to request specific byte ranges from an offered file, there's no reason why the specific feature set shouldn't be up to individual clients. A good example of this is chat history persistence, which has different formats for different clients. This would only become a problem for end users if they want to migrate clients in the middle of a file transfer, and still resume it. That's a bit of a stretch.",
