That would especially aid adoption for mobile systems (for example, smartphones) which suffer battery drain and telco network costs from DHT.\r\n\r\nOnly mentioning this, because I've had at least 3 people abandon the network solely because they're primarily mobile users and consider the forementioned drawbacks unacceptable.",

For example, the first call a client does to `tox_bootstrap()` function in this bouncer library could be treated as address:port:pubkey of a bouncer daemon that the bouncer library should connect to. After the connection is established, all `tox_` functions on the client would be RPC for the remote bouncer, e.g. the client doing `tox_friend_send_message()` would send a RPC to the daemon asking it to send that massage on our behalf and return the function code back to us to give back to the client. The bouncer library could use anything it wants for communicating with the bouncer daemon running on the remote server, from plain HTTPS (which is probably what you want if you want to reduce the network usage) to  toxcore's custom packets.\r\n\r\nYeah, I agree with @sudden6 , that's something that should be a separate library, not a part of the toxcore library.",

Not sure if you are familiar with IRC bouncers, so just imagine the qTox client, which is a GUI + toxcore, but instead of having GUI and toxcore running on your local machine you stll run the GUI running on your machine but the toxcore the GUI communicates with is running on a remote server. You could achieve this by writing a library that pretends to be toxcore, so that qTox would compile against it without any code changes needed, but in actually it wouldn't be a toxcore but rather a library that communicates with the remote toxcore instance.",
