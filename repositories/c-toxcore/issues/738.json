    "body": "The development of Tox is pretty slow. I am talking about toxcore, but also about most clients. There are features that have been requested by users years ago and still nobody is unable to tell when they are going to be finished. Improved group chats, multi device support, offline messaging, sending and receiving messages in order are some of them. Tox also needs a security audit in order to really become secure. I don't know much about them, but I doubt they are cheap.\r\n\r\nThe project survived all those years, even though there have been difficult problems and sometimes developers were even encouraged by other people to quit. Because of that I doubt Tox is going to die any time soon, but the progress is too slow to reach project's goals in any reasonable amount of time. Finishing those features might take years. Most people that need a safe way to communicate can't afford to wait that long.\r\n\r\nOne way (maybe the only one) to speed up the development is to get funding. Tox used to be an organisation once and I think it should become one again. People often ask how to donate and giving money to a random developer is not the best solution. Tox needs more developers spending more time on improving it. I understand that there has been a problem with handling money in the past (https://blog.tox.chat/2015/07/current-situation-3), but it's time to move on and try again. Except this time with a new approach that would decrease the possibility of having a single point of failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Organisations that handle money for open source projects\r\nThere are non profit organisations that will handle projects' money (for example donation money) and might even use it to pay for some of the expenses (domains, hosting etc.) for the project. Here is one such organisation:\r\nhttps://sfconservancy.org (https://sfconservancy.org/about)\r\nSome of the projects (https://sfconservancy.org/projects/current) that are using them: coreboot, Etherpad, Git, Inkscape, Samba, Wine and some smaller projects too.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Join GNU or similar organisation related to free software\r\nI don't know exactly what would the benefits of joining GNU be, but I assume GNU helps with finances and marketing. In exchange they probably demand that the program uses a free software license.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other opportunities from being an organisation\r\n- Mozilla gives money to open source projects: https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/10/03/mozilla-awards-half-million-open-source-projects\r\n- Tox could start participating in Google Summer of Code again\r\n- getting donations from users",

SFC replied about a year after our initial request and by that time no one wanted to deal with the legal stuff anymore (zero-one has left our team and he was the one pushing for this the most).\r\n\r\nGoogle has disallowed Tox participation in 2016 GSoC after the 2015's donation incident, and we didn't apply for GSoC in 2017 and 2018 because a lot of developers became less active or left aroud that time, so we were low on people who can be GSoC mentors and their backup mentors. It takes a lot of work and time to be a mentor, you can't just half-ass it or disappear during it, not to mention that mentor's performance affects Tox's ability to participate in the future GSoCs. Also, GSoC gives something like $500/student donation to the org (not to the student's menor, i.e. it's not a personal donation), and it would be problematic to accept that without having a proper non-for-profit org set up.\r\n\r\niphydf wanted to setup a non-for-profit for TokTok last year, not sure what happened to that.\r\n\r\nWe could try applying to SFC and SIP again, perhaps they are more acceptive now. If we get accepted, we'd need to set up a Tox board for SFC or SIP, deal with legal stuff, decide on how to spend funding, why developer X should receive funding for their work but not developer Y, etc. Not sure if we have enough people who would be willing to take away their time from doing development to deal with this legal stuff instead. It might also require making their personal information public, which not many might be comfortable with. It's worth a try though, I think we should try applying again and then see from there how we should proceed.",

To really have high velocity, you need either one full time developer (expensive) backed by a slightly larger group of code reviewers and occasional contributors (so they are familiar enough with the code to review), or two devs reviewing each others code (even more expensive). If it's less than that, we need to think what to spend money on. I've been trying to stick with free solutions for infrastructure services, but e.g. I recently got access to a FreeBSD machine and it took me an hour to fix LAN discovery on it, which would have been a several day long task without it. This machine costs money, so that's one way to speed up development with money. The prospect of funding has been theoretical, so it's not been a great use of time to plan the spending of an unknown amount of theoretical money. I'm in favour of doing that, if we set a goal for the amount. Then we can optimise the spending for that amount.",

            "body": "**I emailed Richard Stallman, the president of the Free Software Foundation and asked him about what it takes to join GNU. Below are my questions and his answers to them.**\r\n\r\n\r\n  > Could you tell me if it's possible for any free software project to join GNU?\r\n\r\nIf the program runs on the GNU system and meets our ethical standards,\r\nthe program can become part of the GNU Project.  That's done by an\r\nagreement between the leaders of the program's development and the GNU\r\nProject.\r\n\r\n  > What are the requirements and how does GNU help its member\r\n  > projects? I couldn't find any information about this online.\r\n\r\nThings we can do include:\r\n\r\n* Publicize the package.\r\n\r\n* Collect donations for the developers to use for the development of\r\n  the package.\r\n\r\n* Ask other GNU package developers to make changes to work\r\n  better with this package.  (And vice versa.)\r\n\r\nBut the GNU Project is NOT simply a league of various packages that\r\ncooperate to gain more success.  When a package is a GNU Package\r\nthat means it is a part of a larger project, the GNU Project.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the explanation of what it means for a program to be a GNU\r\npackage, which also explains at a general level the responsibilities\r\nof a GNU package maintainer.\r\n\r\nGNU is not simply a collection of useful programs.  We started the GNU\r\nProject with a specific overall goal: to create a free software\r\noperating system, the GNU System.  To keep the GNU system technically\r\ncoherent, we make sure that the parts fit well together.\r\n\r\nThus, becoming a GNU maintainer is a somewhat formal process, since\r\naffiliating with the GNU project as a maintainer means you must agree to\r\nwork (within the confines of the maintenance) with the GNU project's\r\nmission for software freedom.\r\n\r\nHere is the basic explanation.\r\n\r\n======================================================================\r\nMaking a program GNU software means that its developers and the GNU\r\nproject agree that \"This program is part of the GNU project, released\r\nunder the aegis of GNU\"--and say so in the program.\r\n\r\nThe GNU Project appoints package maintainers--initially the main\r\ndevelopers, or those of them who wish to be appointed--to take\r\nresponsibility for the package on the behalf of the GNU project.  We\r\nhope it won't happen, but if they step down, we look for other\r\nmaintainers.  The program remains a GNU package unless/until the GNU\r\nproject decides to drop ties with it.\r\n\r\nBeing a GNU package means we normally put the program on ftp.gnu.org\r\n(although we can instead refer to your choice of ftp site, as long as\r\nit allows connections from anyone anywhere).\r\n\r\nThe official site for the GNU package should be on www.gnu.org,\r\nspecifically in /software/PROGRAMNAME.  Whenever you give out the URL\r\nfor the package home page, you would give this address.  It is ok to\r\nuse another site for secondary topics, such as pages meant for people\r\nhelping develop the package, and for running data bases.  (We can make\r\nan exception, and put the web pages somewhere else, if there is a\r\npressing reason.)\r\n\r\nIt means that the developers agree to pay attention to making the\r\nprogram work well with the rest of the GNU system--and conversely that\r\nthe GNU project will encourage other GNU maintainers to pay attention\r\nto making their programs fit in well with it.\r\n\r\nJust what it means to make programs work well together is mainly a\r\npractical matter that depends on what the program does.  But there are\r\na few general principles.  Certain parts of the GNU coding standards\r\ndirectly affect the consistency of the whole system.  These include\r\nthe standards for configuring and building a program, and the\r\nstandards for command-line options.  It is important to make all GNU\r\nprograms follow these standards, where they are applicable.\r\n\r\nAnother important GNU standard is that GNU programs should come with\r\ndocumentation in Texinfo format.  That is the GNU standard\r\ndocumentation format, and it can be converted automatically into\r\nvarious other formats.  You can use DocBook format or another suitable\r\nformat for the documentation sources, as long as converting it\r\nautomatically into Texinfo gives good results.\r\n\r\nIf a GNU program wants to be extensible, it should use Guile\r\n(https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html) as the programming\r\nlanguage for extensibility, if possible.  For some programs there's a\r\nreason to do things differently, but please use Guile if that is\r\nfeasible.\r\n\r\nA GNU program should use the latest version of the license that the\r\nGNU Project recommends--not just any free software license.  For most\r\npackages, this means releasing under the GNU GPL, \"version 3 or later.\"\r\n\r\nA GNU program should not recommend use of any non-free program, and it\r\nshould not refer the user to any non-free documentation for free\r\nsoftware.  The campaign for free documentation to go with free\r\nsoftware is a major focus of the GNU project (see\r\nhttps://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html); to show that we are\r\nserious about it, we must not undermine our position by recommending\r\ndocumentation that isn't free.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there are issues of terminology which are important for\r\nthe success of the GNU project as a whole.  So we expect maintainers\r\nof GNU programs to follow them.  For example, the documentation files\r\nand comments in the program should speak of GNU/Linux systems, rather\r\nthan calling the whole system \"Linux\", and should use the term \"free\r\nsoftware\" rather than \"open source\".  Since a GNU program is released\r\nunder the auspices of GNU, it should not say anything that contradicts\r\nthe GNU Project's views.\r\n\r\nFor a program to be GNU software does not require transferring\r\ncopyright to the FSF; that is a separate question.  If you transfer\r\nthe copyright to the FSF, the FSF will enforce the GPL for the program\r\nif someone violates it; if you keep the copyright, enforcement will be\r\nup to you.\r\n\r\nAs the GNU maintainer of the package, please make sure to stay in\r\ntouch with the GNU Project.  If we come across a problem relating to\r\nthe package, we need to tell you about it, and to discuss with you how\r\nto solve it.  Sometimes we will need to ask you to work with other\r\nmaintainers to solve a problem that involves using multiple packages\r\ntogether.  This probably will happen less than once a year, but please\r\nmake sure we can contact you in case it does happen.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you decide to step down as maintainer at any time, please\r\ninform us (see https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Stepping-Down.html).\r\n\r\nMore details are available in these documents:\r\n  Information For Maintainers of GNU Software:\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/\r\n\r\n  GNU Coding Standards:\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/\r\n\r\nFor the basic ideas of GNU and free software, please read these essays:\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/compromise.html\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html\r\n  https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html",

As I've said above, I'm more than willing to throw some money at the Tox project if the main work is on features rather than patches. I feel like aligning with the GNU project would have the opposite effect.\r\n\r\nTox isn't the only encrypted IM program out there. Just as a random example, I previously used RetroShare and BitMessage. But Tox is the only one that's user friendly, and works out of the box. Tox is the only program that seems to be for users, rather than for hackers and engineers. Let's not lose the thing that makes Tox unique for the sake of funding.",

At least the worst I've faced with Tox is one friend who has to constantly fiddle with the IPv6 enable/disable setting. It never brought me to the absurd condition of being able to send messages but not receive them, unlike a certain would-be competitor.\r\n\r\nIf an umbrella is a must, maybe something along the lines of KDE, which actually have a few usable programs under their belt.",

GNU has a lot of useful programs (they made an operating system...): https://www.gnu.org/software. This issue is about toxcore library, not the clients. As I said their requirements don't have anything to do with what features a program should have or how it should look like. You can disagree with some of the requirements, but just because some GNU program has issues, doesn't mean joining their project would be bad for us. Tox has a lot of problems too.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's possible to join KDE. Since they are a desktop environment, they probably only care about graphical programs? Toxcore has no UI.\r\n\r\nWe don't have to join any organisation, if we can just create our own and collect donations by ourselves. I'm only asking to do something as soon as possible.",
