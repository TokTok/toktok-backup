Also, swallowing severe code errors tends to hide bugs that could go unnoticed for some time.\n\nTherefore, I would suggest we make a gradual move towards having our APIs accept their whole function domain and encoding bug-checking checks with knowledge of higher layers as assertions.\n\nFor a specific first case and its discussion, see #5.\n",

Violation of function contract. Passing NULL where it's not expected would constitute a contract violation. In file-scope functions, it's a judgement call. In global-scope functions, it makes sense to handle it gracefully, i.e. returning error instead of crashing. This would not be a good candidate for assert (and there I disagree somewhat with the article, which would use assert for that).\n2. Corrupt data structures. These can be more expensive, as they may perform \"fsck\" style checks on data structures. It's unlikely that we currently have these kinds of checks, and they would be a candidate for an [xassertdb](https://github.com/panyam/elkhound/blob/master/smbase/xassert.h#L33)-like macro.\n3. Caller behaviour. This is encoding problem domain knowledge and this is what #5 is changing. The function shouldn't know that all callers must exhibit a certain behaviour. If we want to check that the callers are doing the right thing, an assert makes sense. For example, the function #5 is changing has a check for length > 0, but not for length < 1500 (or some appropriate value < 1500 for which there is a constant), which would make as much sense.\n",

In the section \"Where Do Assertions Come From?\" it is said they exist specifically to denote:\n- pre conditions\n- post conditions\n- invariants\n- _spec_\n\nThe benefit is that if there are many assertions, static analysers could be used at a later stage and start discharging them. Alternatively, the asserts could be used as a basis to start adding contracts (pre/post conditions) in the source code. These can be enforced by static checkers such as frama-c / tis-interpreter. There will be no need to enable them in production as we will have a guarantee that those asserts will never be tripped and thus no performance penalty (they might even speed up execution as the `if` statements become shorter).\n",

The last kind is all the checks that somehow depend on user input, i.e. network traffic or public API calls. These checks will never be elided and the testsuite will actually validate that the implementation performs them.\n",

            "body": "@nbraud the use case is disabling checks that make the code not conform to the conditions we would like it to. The encryption function can sensibly encrypt zero-length strings. In the context of toxcore, there should be no call that actually does it, which is why I initially suggested making it an assert-like failure (abort program, _serious_ bug detected). Still, making the function _specified_ to be partial when it can do sane things with a value from its domain is wrong at this level.\n\nI would turn the null checks into assertions, as well, though of a different kind. No code has any business calling the encryption function with null values, and I would consider null not to be part of the specified interface. It can not do sane things with a null key, so it should not pretend it can. If it does, there is a bug elsewhere we want to know about. @irungentoo disagrees with this, and opts for the graceful degradation route. Right now, it's very hard (almost impossible, without doing abstract interpretation of some kind, i.e. a full audit of all paths leading up to the call) to know whether anything triggers the error condition.\n\nPerhaps we can have a `DEFENSIVE` (name up for debate) macro that is used like:\n\n``` c\nif (DEFENSIVE(length == 0)) {\n  return -1; // or do whatever else to recover from the error and continue working.\n}\n```\n\nThe macro would be something like:\n\n``` c\n#ifdef DISABLE_DEFENSIVE_CHECKS\n#define DEFENSIVE(cond) false\n#else\n#define DEFENSIVE(cond) defensive_check(__FILE__, __LINE__, __func__, #cond, cond)\n#endif\n\nbool defensive_check(char const *file, unsigned int line, char const *func, char const *msg, bool cond);\n```\n\nInside `defensive_check`, we can do different things depending on configuration. We could log failures and optionally abort the program.\n\nBottom line: I want checks for everything, but I want to make sure we mark the different types of checks clearly. Right now, toxcore mixes domain checks (`x != null`), defensive checks (`length != 0`), and dynamic value checks (decryption failed) and they all return -1. There is no way to know what happened and where.\n",
