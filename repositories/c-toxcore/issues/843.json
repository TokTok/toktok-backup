Old core accepts only 1-byte PACKET_ID_ONLINE and works normally. New core concatenates all >1 byte PACKET_ID_ONLINE and provides complete capability info to client.\r\n\r\n> pros:\r\n> - Full compatibility between old and new cores\r\n> - Client can access to capability info just in tox_callback_friend_connection_status\r\n> - Isotoxin already uses this scheme (except concatenation)\r\n> \r\n> cons:\r\n> \r\n>     ?\r\n\r\nFor the second part, the actual encoding, I recently came across a very promising format, http://cbor.io/ or https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049 (despite the .io domain it doesn't seem to be hipster technology).\r\nIn short this is like an improved and binary encoded JSON/MsgPack combination which seems to gain traction in the IETF, especially in the world of embedded systems and IoT, because of low resource usage.\r\n\r\nThe proposed format for capabilities would be a map of features, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    audio : bool,\r\n    video : bool,\r\n    groups : bool,\r\n    files : bool,\r\n    client-id : tstr,\r\n    bot : bool\r\n    ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Message V2:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    msg : tstr,\r\n    sent_hint : int\r\n    ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would then be serialized using CBOR and split into multiple packets as stated above and get passed from toxcore directly to the client.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- very flexible and extensible, more than a struct\r\n- binary format -> lower encoding space needed than any text based format\r\n- seems to be future proof, client picks only keys it's interested in, others are ignored\r\n- there are CBOR parsers form many languages\r\n- supports arbitrary extension, even client specific ones without breaking other clients\r\n- we could base message V2 on this, to do it in a more flexible way this time\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- needs a solid CBOR implementation, which as any parser is not easy to get correct\r\n- a struct is still smaller, but way less flexible",

What's relevant now however is your reasons for either introducing a second binary format next into the toktok stack or migrating everything off msgpack and onto cbor. So basically: what in cbor justifies either the additional cognitive overhead of understanding and maintaining two formats or a migration?",
