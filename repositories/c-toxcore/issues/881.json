So this should work not only for FreeBSD:\r\n```\r\n-#ifdef _WIN32\r\n-#include <malloc.h>\r\n-#elif defined(__FreeBSD__)\r\n #include <stdlib.h>\r\n #if !defined(alloca) && defined(__GNUC__)\r\n #define alloca __builtin_alloca\r\n #endif\r\n-#else\r\n-#include <alloca.h>\r\n-#endif\r\n```\r\nBut quickly patching that doesn't help, I get a spam of undefined references: https://pastebin.com/raw/NbrasTWR\r\nWhat have you done?

            "body": "Thanks for reporting this. I'm very keen on making things portable. The introduction of alloca was to allow compilation on MSVC and other compilers not supporting VLAs. The gcc compilation shouldn't need it. The linker errors you're getting are not related to alloca, but are interesting. It seems the libc is not linked to the library, which can make sense. Some build systems do this on systems where undefined references are supported in dynamic libraries. The linker flag \"-z defs\" is the likely reason for these errors. I'll check with endoffile78 whether removing that flag fixes it.",
