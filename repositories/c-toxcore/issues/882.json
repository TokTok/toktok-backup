My idea is the following: creating the possibility of adding tags to any message in a conversation. \r\nThese system would include the following features:\r\n\r\n•\tTags may be added to a message not just when it is sent, but anytime afterwards.\r\n•\tTags may be added to a message not just by the sender, buy by anyone in the group.\r\n•\tTags have a weight or rating, in such a way that different users may confirm that the tag is correctly associated to a message by voting that tag (i.e. through a “+1” button next to the tag).\r\n\r\nThen, messages could be filtered at any moment, by selecting one or more tags. Therefore, conversations could become organized while they are happening or afterwards.\r\n\r\nAny comments welcome.\r\nBest regards\r\n",

Let's say \"message specific tags\" and \"topic tags\". \r\n\"Message specific tags\" are assigned to a single message. For example, if someone announces a meeting. This could be tagged as \"announcements\", \"important\" or whatever.\r\nOn the other hand, \"topic tags\" are assigned or inherited automatically by means of simple heuristics. For example, if a message is sent very close in time to another, they are considered to belong to the same conversation, so the second message should inherit its topic-tags.  Then, if a group is discussing what movie they are going to see, the first message is tagged as \"movie\", and all messages that follow are tagged automatically. This automatic inheritance could be cleared after a timeout.\r\n\r\nWrong assignments could be addressed with the rating system. A tag could be voted positively or negatively by any group member. Tags could disappear after their rating falls below a given negative threshold.",
