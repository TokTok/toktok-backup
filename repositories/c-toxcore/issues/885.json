So may not be a convient way to keep a computer 24hrs of the day running. But if there was a small application somewhere else which could receive and keep my messages untill I become online and read them all, that could be a good solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nHere is my idea: A small application running on a always online device (e.g. a raspberry pi). This app must have a unique identifier address in the network so anyone can be connected to that just like any other peer. Now, the primary peer connects to this small app and requests that app to receive its messages whenever is offline. The primary peer must also inform the secondary peer about the address and availablity of such service as an alternative address.\r\n\r\nNow, whenever the secondary peer sends a message to the primary peer, at first it tries to find the primary device. If it finds out that the primary device is offline or unreachable, then it can route the message to the alternative address which is the small service running on the always online device.",

This means the DHT cannot be used for **real offline messaging** with files. For **file transfers** a central server can be used :-( but if I disable this \"_**TURN**_\"-server the files can be transfered, too. (Maybe direct peer-to-peer file transfer like TOX?)\r\n\r\nRING was already discussed here: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/3435\r\n",

Most cell phone providers store these text messages **\"only\" 48hours**. \r\n**Have you ever felt unhappy with this limitation of 48hours?** Maybe you did not even know this limitation ;-)\r\nFor being honest, the users of \"**_qTox_**\" or a different PC-client might answer that they need a **_\"time-to-live\"_** for real offline messages of more then **24hours** if they just want to check their messages every evening.\r\n=> **48hours** = right sized **_\"time-to-live\"_** for real offline messages?

Desktop users should be able to provide some sane amount of storage (say 250 or 500 MB). Making offline storage configurable on client will add an option to create \"storage\" node as we do now with bootstrap nodes.

The main idea behind TOX is that every client is (or can be) a server as well.\r\nSure you could distinguish between online messages that are send directly with no server in between.

One possible option would be to require some PoW for storing every message. It might appear that even with PoW it would be possible to attack network. Maybe in this case storage duration can be reduced to day/few days, but it would be nice to have an ability to prolongate storage period (say friend A sends offline message and \"re-sends\" it every day when he's online until friend B will get it).\r\n\r\nI don't have an answer on how it should work, I'm just brainstorming. But I think that offline messages should be as much user friendly as possible, with as much storage duration as possible while still remaining distributed.\r\n\r\n> Technically this would work but this results in a more centralized network structure\r\n\r\nNot really, offline message should be stored in the cluster of several random nodes. These will make storage more reliable and help to recover from cases when node goes down, is malicious, etc.",

This issue is indeed a major thing and clearly, it's what users want... I think it's as wanted as difficult to implement. On mobile clients it's a bit less complicated because users don't shut their devices down and devices are \"always\" (generally speaking) connected (but applications will be shut by Android/iOs...), so even if the node is not connected, there is other ways to inform the device a new message has arrived (push notifications for example). But still, offline messages is necessary.\r\n\r\nA solution can be to change the **ttl** for messages on the DHT. But this solution is followed by a lot of issues. What's the perfect TTL for the current network? Performance? How about flooding the DHT?\r\nThere is also issues about retrieving large amount of new messages when you rerun your node and get old messages from the DHT. Issues about synchronization, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother solution (for RING) can be to use proxy nodes (already implemented in OpenDHT since last year), with an improved version of the value cache introduced this year (still in OpenDHT) to locally store expired values somewhere for the user (like the distributed storage idea). This solution is like (more or less) the one used by the Briar project:  https://code.briarproject.org/goapunk/briar-repeater/tree/master#briar-repeater\r\n\r\nThe second solution is my (perso) favorite for now, because if it's bad, it will just be bad for the proxy, not for the whole network.",

Say I write a bot that keeps storing messages non-stop on the DHT, potentially changing Tox Id / DHT keys / IPs, until no nodes on DHT can store any more messages, since I have filled them out, and my messages won't expire for weeks or even months to boot.\r\n\r\nWe need some way to detect and remove malicious nodes from the network.\r\n\r\n>Do you remember or still use the good old mobile phone text messages? Most cell phone providers store these text messages \"only\" 48hours.\r\nHave you ever felt unhappy with this limitation of 48hours? Maybe you did not even know this limitation ;-)\r\n\r\nMost people who own a phone almost never turn it off. A lot of people use Tox on PC, so it's entirely possible for them to be offline for days.\r\n\r\n>Technically this would work but this results in a more centralized network structure with a single point of failure and so on. The main idea behind TOX is that every client is (or can be) a server as well.\r\n\r\n@dvor meant that in addition to normal nodes that store only a few hundreds megabytes of messages, there could also be bigger servers hosted by volunteers that would host gigabytes of messages. It seems that those people would have the biggest influence over the network and failures of those servers would cost us the most.",

That will cause Tor clients to avoid them for exit connections. They are still useful and will get used for other positions in a circuit.\r\nThe tor directory authority operators who vote on the 'BadExit' flag have the last say on what constitutes being a bad exit. In general we'll flag for the following...\r\n>- Tampering with exit traffic in any way. This is often accidental (for instance filtering by anti-virus).\r\n>- Only allowing plain-text traffic, for instance just allowing traffic through ports 80 and 143. This is because these relays are highly suspicious to be sniffing traffic. For the discussion on this see ​this thread.\r\n>- Numerous exits that collectively provide a high amount of bandwidth but are obviously related without setting the MyFamily entry. \r\n\r\nMore information:\r\nhttps://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/badRelays\r\nhttps://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReportingBadRelays\r\nhttps://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/",

So **64KB** is a \"little bit\" oversized for simple text messages. You might think that the size is so big because you can send small files and VGA-size pictures or thumbnails via OpenDHT but unfortunately this is not supported yet.\r\n\r\nA **higher risk** could be the unexpected success of such a messenger due to **limited scalability**. Imagine if suddenly 1million, 10 million or even more than 100million users want to use it. ;-) (for comparison WhatsApp or WeChat have round about 1000million users each)",

What's good in having a feature -- real offline messaging -- that you can't rely on working? Doesn't a feature that doesn't work mean that it's bugged? Why would you write a bugged feature? Are you suggesting to just ignore the issue of it being attacked and simply rely on peers being benign and well-behaved? It's a free file storage, even though you can't simply HTTP GET it, pretty sure there would still be people who would jump on it, especially if you allow storing things for long periods of time. Not to mention your everyday script kiddies or hackers trying to pwn everything they can for fun and fame, or potentially even a government state trying to disrupt the operation of a messenger (though they are a lot more likely to disrupt the more essential functionality like the peer discovery rather than the optional offline message storage functionality).\r\n\r\n>limiting the number of messages per time and per IP-address (maybe max. 1 message per second)\r\n\r\nIt's not possible to impose such restrictions without some kind of centralization. Peers have no ability to know the message rate of any given peer, they also can't trust any peer to report the message rate accurately as there is nothing preventing them from lying.\r\n\r\n>right-sized limit of the max. allowed message or file size\r\n\r\nThere is no issue with imposing a message size restriction, however.\r\n\r\n>A higher risk could be the unexpected success of such a messenger due to limited scalability. Imagine if suddenly 1million, 10 million or even more than 100million users want to use it. ;-)\r\n\r\nScalability should be addressed properly indeed. Both attacks and scalability should be considerate, you can't really ignore one or the other.",

XMPP is **only decentral not distributed** (If the server you have choosen fails then you are offline)\r\n2. the public XMPP-servers offer very different features/extensions and configuration parameters (very different time-to-live for offline messages, some support file transfers and some not ...) So the **features you can use**, always **depend on** the features offered by the **server and the client of your friend**, too.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless the **_\"conversations\"_**-messenger seems to be a very remarkable messenger:\r\n- real offline messaging for text and files (if supported by choosen server)\r\n- file size compression for pictures\r\n- automatically accept files options\r\n- out-of-the-box OMEMO-encryption for text and files/pictures\r\n- sending audio and video messages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
