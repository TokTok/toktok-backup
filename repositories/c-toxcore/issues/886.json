They all crashed due to the small stack size limit of musl-libc(80K).\r\n\r\nSince there're already two applications having crashed, i think we should have a discussion: should the caller of the `setstacksize()` be applications, or the toxcore library?\r\n\r\nI prefer patching library, since i just have 28 friends, plus the nodes info and so, it's so small a scale, but it crashed. It may be very easy to touch the stack size limit of musl, and patching library will make things much more convenient.\r\n\r\nAs for the size, 512K should be big enough, as i said in https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/5127. But i think we need to think more about it, estimating the stack size generally cost by the library. Anybody have idea on how to do this?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: https://github.com/qTox/qTox/issues/5127#issuecomment-387507909. sudden6 pointed out that this maybe a bug or an oversight in toxcore or qtox, because toxcore should not take so much stack in his opinion.",

I shall fix this and report later if i find more oversights\r\n\r\nBest\r\nJoão\r\n\r\nedit: that appears to fix the crash, can provide a patch if required but its a simple fix just allocate \"clients\" with malloc instead of trying to allocate with the stack",
