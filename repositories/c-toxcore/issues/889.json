It has nothing to do with INLINE images, stickers, voicemail where we can send the thumbnail/notification first.\r\n\r\nEnabling auto-accept for INLINE in client will just disable thumbnails and all the INLINE media will be auto accepted which could be a useful for a desktop client where you have fast connection and want to just accept whatever the certain contact sends you.",
