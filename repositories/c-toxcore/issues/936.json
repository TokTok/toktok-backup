I am trying to add few Tox Id's to my client for testing.I just want to show them in a menu in contacts list. How and where do I get some dummy tox Ids for testing.\r\nI only got two machines on which I run a toxic client on each, these two client's Ids are only added to each other.If I want to add more Tox Ids on each of them how do I do that? I want to show some dummy ids and their corresponding names in a menu.As I could not get more tox Ids I cannot test the menu.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n",
