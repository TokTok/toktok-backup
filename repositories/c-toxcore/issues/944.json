A friend as if says that he is very busy and asks him not to disturb. But nevertheless, if there is an urgent need, I can still write to friend or call him. If I interpret the TOX_USER_STATUS_BUSY flag as a busy-state, it can happen that I can not reach my friend for a very long time. For example, the qtox friend set the TOX_USER_STATUS_BUSES flag, and then forgot to remove it.\r\nSo I thought that do not need to assign a second meaning to TOX_USER_STATUS_BUSES flag.
