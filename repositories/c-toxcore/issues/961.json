I appear as online and I can message people, but I am not able to send messages to a group or groups. Normally if I lost connection to a group, I should just be reconnected, but here that never happens. The only way for me to be able to send messages again is to manually leave the group and join it again or restart the client.",

When they rejoined, all peers couldn't hear them, but A could hear all peers, and all peers didn't receive A's text messages, but A saw their own.\r\n\r\n> Which pairs of A,B,C were tox friends?\r\n\r\nA was friends with B and C\r\nB was friends with A, C, and D\r\nC was friends with A and B\r\nD was friends with B\r\n\r\n> Did any of the members join or leave any other groups?\r\n\r\nNo. All 4 were in a group audio call playing some games - none were doing anything tox related.\r\n\r\n> Am I right to understand that during the period when A's messages\r\nweren't being sent to everyone, A nonetheless saw both B and C in the\r\npeer list for the group (except during brief disconnections)?\r\n\r\nYes. B, C, D in this case all showed in the peer list, and A was receiving audio for all of them.\r\n\r\nA leaving and being re-invited to the group did not fix the issue, and A restarting their client did not fix the issue. All 4 members needed to move to a new group, where things then worked.\r\n\r\nA was using qTox which saves the tox profile pretty rarely - only on friend add/remove basically, so I don't see how the qTox crash during the call could somehow corrupt tox profile state - but possibly the crash is an important part of the repro.",

I believe I see the problem now: \nmessages from a particular peer come with a \"message number\", \nincremented with each message from that peer, and messages with too old \na message number are ignored by other peers. The current message number \nis saved in the savedata, but if there's a crash and the peer restarts \nfrom an old save file, they'll start from an old message number and so \nother peers will ignore them. In particular they ignore the kill message \nthat the peer sends if it leaves the group, which explains why leaving \nand rejoining doesn't help - the other peers don't even realise the peer \nleft.\n\nAll this goes for audio too (there's a separate message number for lossy \npackets).\n\nThis may take some thought to fix properly.\n",
