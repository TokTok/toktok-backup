            "body": "The API is very suitable for the use case of displaying metric to the English-speaking user in a two-column table of `| name | value |`, however it's badly suited for being processed by a machine to construct graphs and such, as it would have to rely on metric names to never change. A more machine-friendly version would allow querying metric by enum, e.g. `tox_metric_get_value(tox, TOX_METRIC_TCP_SERVER_TRAFFIC);`. It also might make sense to return an array of ints instead of just a single int, as some metrics could be arrays. Some metrics can also be other types than an int, e.g. an array of IPs of all DHT nodes in the routing table and perhaps the amount of traffic exchanged with each of them, you know, like the peer list in torrent clients. What about a list of onion paths constructed? Or list of IPs of nodes that misbehave, e.g. that have sent badly formatted packets, you could probably even fail2ban those if you think they are fuzzing/DoSing you (though you run in the issue of firewalling a TCP relay node).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things a metric API can be made to provide, so what exactly do we want from it? Are integer-only metrics, `| name | value |` user facing table and machine generated graphs that look for the exact match on `name` string is what we have decided on?",
