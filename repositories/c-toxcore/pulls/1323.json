            "body": "Testing these RTT changes more thoroughly and reproducibly, I don't think they improve transfer times. Building on them, I think another problem with RTT calculation is that a packets sent_time is reset when the packet is resent, but still used for RTT which can cause the following:\r\n0ms: packet A is sent with RTT 500ms\r\n550ms: request packet is received stating A wasn't received\r\n550ms: A is resent, sent time is updated to now.\r\n551ms: request packet is received stating A was received (from the first packet that was received).\r\n\r\nwhich causes us to have an unreasonably short RTT of 51ms, and then think that all of our outstanding packets with a true RTT of ~500ms have been dropped because they haven't been delivered within 51ms. Using the original sent_time isn't necessarily valid either, since the packet may well have legitimately been dropped.\r\n\r\nTracking when packets are resent and not using their sent_time for RTT calculation reduces the number of packets we think are dropped and improves overall transfer speed by about 2x in my testing, and traffic shape is a little less saw-tooth-y, but still not great. It looks like after this change, the target speed coming out of congestion control is still very volatile, with `packet_send_rate` thrashing from ~0 to ~300 back and forth during transmission, I'll continue investigating.",

Without it the transfer speed in qTox is complete garbage. This patch keeps my transfer speed at 9-11 mb/s. In normal toxcore qTox reaches the highest speed and then it dramatically drops down to zero, then it starts to grow up again, repeat. On portable devices which use Wi-fi or LTE it's twice that bad. I'm going to make a separate version of Protox which includes this patch. I also recommend to merge this patch ASAP.\r\n\r\nMy tests on protox (over Wi-fi):\r\nP.S.
