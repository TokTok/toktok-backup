I knew this commit was going to be huge, but I didn't know how big.\nThere's no way to make this smaller, without breaking more stuff, as it is, it\nonly compiles if you\n./configure --disable-tests --disable-testing --disable-av ...\n\nFor the most of it, It's a lot of sane renames, and close consideration. With\nthe notable exception of group.{c,h} & tox_old_code.h. Both of which I decided\nto do bulk replacements of *Group_Chats to *Tox, and linking the code on line 1\nof the function to avoid changing a lot of lines with important code. I decided\nto do it this way because the global plan for toxcore is to replace the current\ngroupchats with something better. So this change was quick, instead of detailed.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/toktok/toxcore/19)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",

It's a little messy around the save new save functions you wrote (removed). They're coming next.\n\n@Encrypt @endoffile78 Same as #18, the more toxcore code you see the more you'll be able to help.

All of the \"core\" logic right now is done through messenger. That requires Messenger to exist for any other section to be active/working. It also means you can't interact with anything on a lower level without also changing Messenger. Considering the other levels of abstraction/separation throughout toxcore, this doesn't' make much sense. It also limits what you can do with toxcore in the future. There's no reason to run a whole Messenger, if you're just running a bootstrap node. (Which IMO  currently exists as hack, and not really as it should be). You also can't disable the DHT without doing something stupid to Messenger. This would be a huge benefit to mobile users, to be able to turn on and off the DHT while still maintaining their active session and connections to existing contacts. Also group chats, there's no reason to start a Messenger instance and join the DHT if you're only interested in a single group chat. Doing it this way also allows other pending features, like Multi-Device, ToxVPN, ToxFileServer, ToxAsAService, all to exist seperate from, or in addition to Messenger, without interfering.  \n\nI have a few more ideas/plans for Toxcore that would be a lot simpler to implement and advantageous as a feature with this change. \n\n---\n\nReview status: 0 of 20 files reviewed at latest revision, 3 unresolved discussions, some commit checks failed.\n\n---\n\n_[toxcore/tox.h, line 40 [r1]](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/toktok/toxcore/19#-KOcAXSFbwpXeXEURX0H:-KOcISuShTmyN4vlNkdE:b-l4r14j) ([raw file](https://github.com/toktok/toxcore/blob/d9c103f4ddf7e0427b7eef68810594be7389e8e9/toxcore/tox.h#L40)):_\n<details><summary>\n\n<i>Previously, nurupo wrote…</i></summary>\n\n\n\n> _cough_ _cough_\n> \n> This will also cause Travis to fail.\n> </details>\n> I'll fix this once this PR is a little closer to final.\n\n---\n\n_[toxcore/tox.h, line 153 [r1]](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/toktok/toxcore/19#-KOcCC7-1r8mtBuv949L:-KOcIZqP4_sogyp26iF7:b12xcyr) ([raw file](https://github.com/toktok/toxcore/blob/d9c103f4ddf7e0427b7eef68810594be7389e8e9/toxcore/tox.h#L153)):_\n<details><summary>\n\n<i>Previously, nurupo wrote…</i></summary>\n\n\n\n> Don't think it's a good idea to increment version in a feature PR.
