            "body": "There is just interface with no implementation. I take that you want to agree on the interface before starting doing the implementation?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBtw, don't think I ever got anything other than \"too many macros\" when asking you to review the `[writable|readable]_network_buffer` (`[w|r]nb`), which is very similar to this binary writer, except that it additionally performs byte-order conversion: from host to network on writing and from network to host when reading.\r\n\r\n- [Final version](https://gist.github.com/nurupo/2228a603fb4b22a10d82fe5b1aa5ef1b)\r\n  The final version of `[w|r]nb` uses a dynamically resizable array called `Vector`, which mimics C++'s std::vector interface but implements only a limited subset of it that is required for `[w|r]nb`. `Vector` was introduced so that you wouldn't have to specify the exact length of the buffer for `writable_network_buffer`, you could just write things into the buffer and it would resize the underlying array for you, e.g., using your interface from this PR, instead of doing `bin_w_new(sizeof(something) + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + (n * m) + sizeof(uint32_t) + sizeof(DHT_Node)*nodes);` you would just do `bin_w_new();` and you can write as many things as 2^16 bytes, which is the limit in my implementation that can be easily raised.\r\n  - Usage of `writable_network_buffer`\r\n    - create `wnb`\r\n    - write things into it, it converts the byte order from host to network of the things you write\r\n    - writing always appends data to the end\r\n    - you can write as many thing as 2^16 bytes (that limit can be easily raised), the underlying array would automatically resize\r\n    - when you are done writing, you can get detach (take over the memory ownership) the data written into it as a `Vector`\r\n  - Usage of `readable_network_buffer`\r\n    - create `rnb` by attaching (giving up memory ownership of) a `Vector` object with data in it\r\n    - read things from it, it converts the byte order from network to host of the things you read\r\n    - reading always takes data from the front\r\n    - you can't read more than the `Vector` contains, you get an error returned if you try to\r\n    - when you are done reading, you `free()` `rnb`, which frees the `Vector` you gave up the ownership of\r\n\r\n- [Initial version](https://gist.github.com/nurupo/2228a603fb4b22a10d82fe5b1aa5ef1b/a4655a4e15f6e314cd7baeca02e674d9d1fbf538)\r\n  This version doesn't use `Vector` and expects the user to allocate the memory on their own. This implementation can be used without any `free()` calls, i.e. you can allocate a VLA on stack, attach a `buffer_writer` onto the array, write things into the array using the `buffer_writer` and be done with it -- no need to deallocate anything, stack unwinding would destroy the `buffer_writer` and VLA. You need to know the length of the data you want to write into the array though, since you don't use `Vector`.\r\n  - Usage of `buffer_writer`\r\n    - create `bw` by passing it `(data, length)` pair of pre-allocated array\r\n    - write things into it, it converts the byte order from host to network of the things you write\r\n    - writing always appends data to the end\r\n    - you can't write more than the `length` of the array, you get an error returned if you try to\r\n    - when you are done writing -- you are done, as there is no cleanup step you need to perform\r\n  - Usage of `buffer_reader`\r\n    - create `br` by passing it `(data, length)` pair of array containing data in it\r\n    - read things from it, it converts the byte order from network to host of the things you read\r\n    - reading always takes data from the front\r\n    - you can't read more than the `length` of the array, you get an error returned if you try to\r\n    - when you are done reading -- you are done, as there is no cleanup step you need to perform",
