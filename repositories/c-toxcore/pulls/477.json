It would also be nice to add instructions for MSVC, but there is an issue that one can't currently build toxav with MSVC as cmake doesn't know where to look for opus and vpx without relying on pkg-config. We might want to solve this before adding MSVC instructions. It might make sense to move away from using pkg-config in cmake to using the cmake's `find_package()` (though we could just have both). I started working on writing `FindX.cmake` for every Tox dependency so that `find_package()` could find it, but I haven't finished and probably won't come back to it in a while. I can push my progress to a branch on my fork if someone wants to take it over.\r\n\r\nI think there also were some new cmake options added recently, which need to be added to `INSTALL.md`.\r\n\r\nSomething to keep in mind after this PR is merged, in that the `INSTALL.md` would need to be kept in syn with cmake options, their defaults, etc. It also needs to be kept in sync with the Dockerfile options and their defaults. Writing a script for auto-updating `INSTALL.md` might make sense.\r\n\r\n>Neat! @nurupo would you mind adding a travis build using docker that builds the image? (It's ok to say no, I'm still happy with this change).\r\n\r\nHeh, I wouldn't really call it neat, I'm not very happy with the shell scripts, you have to read the entire thing (all the scripts) to understand what the variables are used for and where the things are done in fs, so there is that.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Travis build goes, I will try adding a Travis build for it later this week if I will have time.",

Previously it said that toxcore doesn't support building with MSVC under cmake, but now it kind of does support it in a limited no-toxav sense and if you put the libraries in [the exact paths cmake expects to find them at](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/master/cmake/Dependencies.cmake#L36-L103). Should I document the library paths? They are a bit of a mess, most library paths are in the current directory (can be re-rotted to any directory with `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` option provided by the user), yet other are in the Program Files. It's also a bit of a mess that cmake doesn't look for toxav dependencies and thus is unable to build toxav with MSVC.\r\n\r\nAlso, is it really a good idea to have the pre-built section mentioning which distributions have toxcore in their package repository and also linking to windows nightly builds of toxcore? I don't feel especially strongly about it.\r\n\r\nWhat do I do with the Travis builds? I left them unconditioned to let you see that they work. I assume you will ask me to put them under the cron condition after you are happy with the PR.",
