    "body": "I have wanted to make the daemon report toxcore's version for quite a bit now, and here I finally I got around to doing this. The main motivation for this was the onion vulnerability https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/873. To fix the vulnerability, all DHT nodes should be updated to the new upcoming toxcore version. Reporting toxcore version in the bootstrap daemon would enable us to see at the very least if the bootstrap nodes are updated, my main interest being the the nodes that are listed on the https://nodes.tox.chat page which displays the daemon version of the nodes.\r\n\r\nThe daemon version is just a `uint32_t`, there is not much you can encode in 4 bytes. I have been thinking of packing the toxcore version into that `uint32_t`, 1 byte for major, 1 byte for minor, 1 byte for patch and 1 byte for misc: bit indicating that this is a new version scheme, a bit indicating that the daemon was build using a release checkpoint of toxcore rather than an in-development (there might be big differences between 2.x.y release and the same 2.x.y right before the version bump, containing all the changes for the next version). Such version encoding would be inconsistent with the previous one of `YYYYMMDD`, which you could print out as an number to show the version to the user, which is what nodes.tox.chat and a few other scrips do. With the packed version encoding the version would need to be decoded first, if you print the `uint32_t` as it is, it won't make sense. So to keep the compatibility with the way the daemon version is being printed by others I settled on a `1AAABBBCCC` format, where `AAA` is the major version, `BBB` is the minor version and `CCC` is the patch version, all capped at 999. The leading 1 is just so that the leading zeros wouldn't get removed when printing it as a number, e.g. instead of `0.2.1` being printed as `2001`, it would be printed as `1000002001`, i.e. 000.002.001.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/toktok/c-toxcore/875)\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",

Nothing stops you from updating it to define DAEMON_VERSION_NUMBER 2018041700UL.\r\n\r\nRight, I could update it like that, but it would be more meaningful if the version reflected the toxcore version instead. The daemon usually doesn't change much at all, it can stay for a year without a single change aside from refactoring, yet toxcore changes a lot faster and changes the daemon's behavior, like the recent DHT changes in toxcore aimed to reduce the bandwidth consumption.\r\n\r\n>Don't forget you are not the only one who is implementing toxcore. These changes are changes in protocol and must be discussed with all implementors of tox.\r\n\r\nIt would make sense to extend the daemon's version information to include daemon name and version **and** the name and version of the toxcore implementation it uses then. Don't think this is going to fit into 4 bytes though, we'd likely need some string for that, so some spec change is needed.\r\n\r\n>Please stop juggling with bits and bytes.

Also, all programs that check the bootstrap version that I know of: [bootstrap_node_info](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/master/other/fun/bootstrap_node_info.py) and [Tox Status](https://github.com/Tox/ToxStatus) treat it as an integer without any regards to its scheme just as the spec defines it.
