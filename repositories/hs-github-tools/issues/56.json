    "body": "Currently, we are using the `github` package, which doesn't aim for perfectly implementing the GitHub API, for API requests. We do require that for our future plans, so now we need our own request implementation.\r\n\r\nAs a first step, this can simply call the API through an [http client](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client-0.5.5/docs/Network-HTTP-Client.html). Later we can think about an abstraction. The existing github package allows you to create request objects and later pass them to a manager. I think that's a bit cumbersome and doesn't add much value, because you still need to pass around the http connection manager and authentication. My suggestion here would be to use a Free monad instead, and have the interpreter deal with setting up http managers and authentication.",
