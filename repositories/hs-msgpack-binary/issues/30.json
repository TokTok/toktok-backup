I see the `MessagePack` class now has\r\n```haskell\r\nfromObject :: (Applicative m, Monad m) => Object -> m a\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```haskell\r\nfromObject :: Object -> Maybe a\r\n```\r\nCan you explain the rationale for this change? I see no reason why `fromObject` needs to work polymorphically over all monads, it has nothing to do with monads at all! You end up using just the `fail` method for all your instances. At best, you could change `Maybe a` to `Either Error a` using an `Error` datatype.",

What I really want here is `MonadFail`, but that's currently not portable to all the targets I want to support. `fromObject` does have a lot to do with monads, though, and the polymorphic definition is mostly compatible with code that uses `Maybe`, while changing it to another concrete instance of `Monad` is incompatible.\r\n\r\nWhy do you say it has nothing to do with monads? For the simplest cases, it requires at least `Functor`, and for slightly more complex cases (product types), it will need `Applicative`. In general, it's entirely reasonable to need a `Monad` for decoding values, e.g. when decoding sum types: you need to first decode the object to `(Int, Object)`, use the `Int` to select the constructor, and then decode the `Object` to its arguments.\r\n\r\nYou're arguing for using a specific instance of `Monad` rather than abstracting over arbitrary ones. I changed this, because I wanted to allow users to run `fromObject` in an arbitrary monad, such as `Data.Binary.Get`. I can be convinced to use `Either`, instead, but it would be an incompatible change.\r\n\r\nWhy do you feel this is a problem? Are you running into performance issues due to the abstraction?",
