[store](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/store) seems to be [faster](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/05/store-package). By separating the types and the specific serialiser, we can give the user a choice, and we can provide at least two implementations: one correct one (the existing one) and one fast one. We can then do random quickcheck-style equivalence testing between the two to make sure the fast one is also correct.",
