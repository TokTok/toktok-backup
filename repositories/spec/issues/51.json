They reference use of a server on page 3,4,6,7,8 and possibly later as well.\r\n\r\nThat's not what I asked. Deducing from the use of servers the necesity of servers is a logical fallacy.\r\nOf course, signal protocol can be and in fact is used on servers. Whatsapp requires servers and so does Signal (the App). But that does not mean the protocol needs servers. The server is a convenience for storing things for others. It's like saying messengers need servers because Whatsapp is a messenger and Whatsapp needs a server. There are, however, messengers that do not need servers, like tox, torchat, ...\r\nNot having a server means, there is no place you can get prekeys from, other than your contact. That is no problem, since as of now you cannot send messages to contacts you have never seen before when they are offline, anyway. In fact, you cannot send messages to any offline contact in tox.\r\nOn page four the cited paper says \"Alice  requests  and  receives  some  information  about  Bob  (either  from  the  central  server  or  from  Bob himself)\".  Note the \"or from Bob himself\" part, which clearly shows that the server is not a necessity.\r\n\r\n>> This is not true. Tox users NEVER exchange session keys, Tox does that.\r\n\r\n>No, tox generates them, but again, that's a semantic difference. They're created off a DHT key, and a ToxID (the public key).\r\n\r\nSo? Anyway, aren't DHT keys totally unrelated? (metadata)\r\n\r\n>> signal and/or noise are used by Signal, a very nice, secure messenger, by whatsapp\r\n\r\n> Whatsapp is a fucking joke. And as such, no one who understands security or crypto should honestly suggest them in a scenario where security could be important.\r\n\r\nYou misunderstood: I did not recommend using Whatsapp. Not becasue I distrust the crypto they use, quite the opposite, but mainly because it is closed source. I was talking about exposure.",

Finding friends is a matter of the DHT, not of key exchange or key derivation. And Tox also treats contacts as immutable, c.f. Tox ID - if your Tox ID changes you need to exchange that with your contact out of band again. ",
