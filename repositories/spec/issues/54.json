See, Tox heavily relies on NaCl/sodium crypto library, to the point that you can't change the underlying crypto without breaking Tox protocol. NaCl library provides both encryption and signing functionality, with just one caveat -- you can't you your encryption keypair for signing, the signing operations require you to generate a special signing keypair, the encryption keypair won't do it. So while saying \"and sign it with our long term private key\" is the correct conceptual idea of what is happening, in the actually what is happening is that you encrypt rather than sign. When @irungentoo was writing the spec he was pretty much going all over the toxcore implementation (the spec was written after the implementation), writing out what the implementation is doing exactly with all the nitty-gritty details, instead of writing a conceptual specification of a Tox protocol. Due to this, it's probably better just to clarify the intention in the following sentence, e.g. \"the encryption here is used as a signature -- to prove that we actually own the private key\", which, now that I read your quote, is already done with\r\n\r\n>This is so the peer we are announcing ourselves to can be sure that we actually own that public key.",
