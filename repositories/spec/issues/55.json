All communication with these \nnodes is done over the onion, bouncing the request via multiple (3) \npeers. Assuming the first peer in the route is not colluding with the \ndestination peer, and assuming no network-level attacks, the destination \npeer should not be able to determine the IP_Port of the sender. But they \nwill be able to get a message back, by using the same onion route in \nreverse.\n\nIt might be nice to have an overview section in the spec, explaining \ngeneral concepts like this without getting into implementation details.\n",
