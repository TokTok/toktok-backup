This way we can just unwrap the beginning, look if it was targeted to us, if not - add encrypted address to the end and forward packet further. Using this technic no node in the middle will know how many addresses were unwrapped before it and how many left after.\r\n\r\n### Concerns with solution\r\nI'm not crypto expert, so I'm not sure if lack of wrapping into multiple encrypted layers reduces effective security. Especially for the address appended to the end of the packet that moves unchanged encrypted pieces closer to the beginning of the packet. It feels like it shouldn't (assuming secure encryption method and only protection against limited observer that can't observer the whole onion path), but would be nice if someone can confirm this.\r\n\r\n### Further thoughts\r\nThis approach would allow us to even hide exact number of hops used in onion path from everyone except receiver if we want to do so (we can append some random bytes to payload and only receiver will not that). Also implementation will become much smaller and more generic than current hardcoded `handle_send_1`, `handle_send_2` and the likes.",

            "body": "I've been thinking about this issue and some others for my project and come up with early protocol framework that hides more information than Tox's onion currently (fixes this particular issue) and is much simpler than Tor's onion implementation. It also is more uniform than Tox's routing handling, so that there will be no need to create separate functions for different node positions in onion path.\r\nIf someone have a bit of free time I'd be thankful for any feedback: https://github.com/nazar-pc/ronion/blob/master/spec.md\r\nImplementation doesn't exist yet.\r\n\r\nUPD: Implementation is already in the repository.",
