            "body": "> - Github tracks formal contributors already.\n> - git history contains all formal contributors as well.\n> - The file can go out of date.\n> \n> Better question: why is it beneficial and/or needed?\n\nWell, the only reason is that copyright notice should provide info about copyright holders - i.e. if not list them, at least point to the place in provided \"source\" files where entities holding copyright are listed.\n\nWhile git(hub) takes care of that, in a case where one decides to e.g. get only source (e.g. \"download as .zip\") the source they obtain would no longer contain info about copyright holders. Given that current license (MIT) requires listing copyright holders, not storing that info in something that would be always provided with \"source\" would equal to breaching terms of license.\n\n> - Would the contributors file contain informal contributors (people providing input e.g. in discussions elsewhere)? If not, would it contain all formal contributors or only those with significant contributions? If the latter, what is a significant contribution? E.g. a typo correction may not be, but then what is?\n\nAnything that counts as copyrighted work that would modify \"source\".\nLegally e.g. correcting typo wouldn't really count, but it's generally nice to \"acknowledge\" someone's contribution, whatever it may be - on the other hand, if not doing that, it would require venturing into territory of trying to estimate each change in terms of whether it would count as copyrightable work... IMHO that would be a waste of effort, and be prone to errors.\nThus, any contribution that modifies \"source\" seems like a good option, IMHO.\n\n> - Ideally this document belongs to the world, not to any author, and contributors would acknowledge that their contribution is \"public domain\".\n\nSince public domain isn't really acknowledged in all jurisdictions, the ~closest to it is CC0 – which is not possible ATM to use, given that MIT requires preserving copyright notice, and AFAIK CC0 does not, which would render re-licensing `MIT → CC0` impossible without irungentoo's consent.\n",
