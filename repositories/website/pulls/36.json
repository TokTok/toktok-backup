One of the reviews must be from a developer. The two other reviews\n+can be from a developer but can also be from the community. The idea is that\n+the community, i.e. the Tox/TokTok users, can have direct influence on how the\n+code and surrounding elements evolve. This page explains to a new GitHub user\n+how to engage in a community review.\n+\n+# Step 1: Look over the PR list\n+\n+Take a look at the [pulls](pulls.html) page on this website. It lists all the\n+repositories that currently have open pull requests. The first column (marked\n+with \"#\") is the PR number. Clicking on a PR number brings you into the\n+Reviewable UI. The branch name links to the GitHub pull request itself.\n+\n+You can start by reading through the PR titles and see if anything catches\n+your interest. You can also just randomly click on some PR numbers and enter\n+the review. Everyone is allowed to review any number of PRs they like. You can\n+post review comments and engage in discussions. You are welcome, and we will\n+be happy to learn about any questions, concerns, or thougths you'd like to\n+express.\n+\n+# Step 2: Log in to Reviewable\n+\n+-   Open the Reviewable link in the \"#\" column on the page or on GitHub in the\n+    PR description itself.\n+-   It will ask you for some permissions. You can safely grant them.\n+    Reviewable will not write to your repositories, it only needs those to be\n+    able to edit comments and add the Reviewable link.\n+-   You should now see a page like the one below.\n+-   As you can see, there is a **SHOW UNREVIEWED DIFFS** button. When you\n+    click this button, you should be able to see the changes under review.\n+\n+![Step 2](static/img/reviews/step2.png)\n+\n+# Step 3\n+\n+-   Scroll down to see the file changes. You will find something like the\n+    screenshot below. Here, we see that someone changed a `4` into a `6` in a\n+    file named `DHT.c`. The PR description explains why this was done: \"Fix\n+    logging condition for IPv6 client timestamp updates\".\n+-   Now comes your review: your task is now to check whether the change makes\n+    sense. In this example, we see that `assoc4` was checked in an IPv6 code\n+    block. Now that is fixed. Seems legit. :)\n+-   If you don't understand what this change does, ask a question. We will be\n+    happy to explain what we're doing. This helps not only you, but also\n+    anyone in the future who may be digging through the commit history. It",

            "diff_hunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,106 @@\n+---\n+layout: default\n+title: \"How to: community review\"\n+permalink: reviews.html\n+menu_index: 11\n+---\n+\n+The TokTok review process requires at least three reviews for every pull\n+request. One of the reviews must be from a developer. The two other reviews\n+can be from a developer but can also be from the community. The idea is that\n+the community, i.e. the Tox/TokTok users, can have direct influence on how the\n+code and surrounding elements evolve. This page explains to a new GitHub user\n+how to engage in a community review.\n+\n+# Step 1: Look over the PR list\n+\n+Take a look at the [pulls](pulls.html) page on this website. It lists all the\n+repositories that currently have open pull requests. The first column (marked\n+with \"#\") is the PR number. Clicking on a PR number brings you into the\n+Reviewable UI. The branch name links to the GitHub pull request itself.\n+\n+You can start by reading through the PR titles and see if anything catches\n+your interest. You can also just randomly click on some PR numbers and enter\n+the review. Everyone is allowed to review any number of PRs they like. You can\n+post review comments and engage in discussions. You are welcome, and we will\n+be happy to learn about any questions, concerns, or thougths you'd like to\n+express.\n+\n+# Step 2: Log in to Reviewable\n+\n+-   Open the Reviewable link in the \"#\" column on the page or on GitHub in the\n+    PR description itself.\n+-   It will ask you for some permissions. You can safely grant them.\n+    Reviewable will not write to your repositories, it only needs those to be\n+    able to edit comments and add the Reviewable link.\n+-   You should now see a page like the one below.\n+-   As you can see, there is a **SHOW UNREVIEWED DIFFS** button. When you\n+    click this button, you should be able to see the changes under review.\n+\n+![Step 2](static/img/reviews/step2.png)\n+\n+# Step 3\n+\n+-   Scroll down to see the file changes. You will find something like the\n+    screenshot below. Here, we see that someone changed a `4` into a `6` in a\n+    file named `DHT.c`. The PR description explains why this was done: \"Fix\n+    logging condition for IPv6 client timestamp updates\".\n+-   Now comes your review: your task is now to check whether the change makes\n+    sense. In this example, we see that `assoc4` was checked in an IPv6 code\n+    block. Now that is fixed. Seems legit. :)\n+-   If you don't understand what this change does, ask a question. We will be\n+    happy to explain what we're doing. This helps not only you, but also\n+    anyone in the future who may be digging through the commit history. It\n+    also helps us keep a high standard of documenting changes and maintains\n+    transparency towards the community and potential new contributors.\n+-   To ask a question or express a concern with a change, click the line you\n+    want to comment on. This opens a text editor where you can write your\n+    comment in\n+    [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\n+    format.\n+\n+![Step 3](static/img/reviews/step3.png)\n+\n+# Step 4\n+\n+When you are done with a file, click the eye symbol in the corner. This marks\n+the file as reviewed. Even if you have put comments on it, still mark it as\n+reviewed, which just means that you saw it. It does not mean that you consider\n+the file OK. Your comments need to be explicitly marked resolved by you",

If I remove this, I need to comment out the references in the Gemfile as well. It doesn't seem to add much time (still about 1 minute 50 seconds like some other page builds).
